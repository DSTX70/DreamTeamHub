+# EVID-0004 — IP Pod Operating System (Aegis/Atlas/Archivist/Sentinel/Praetor/Coda)
+
+## Problem
+High-value IP work (patents/trademarks/privacy/OSS compliance) can degrade quickly without a consistent operating system: unclear handoffs, missing evidence, disclosure risk, and weak traceability from claims to implementation.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be repeatable across brands/repos
+- Must protect confidential strategy and sensitive disclosures
+- Must produce filing-grade artifacts with clear deadlines and ownership
+- Must remain “decision-grade” (auditable, evidence-backed, defensible)
+
+## Approach (Operating System)
+**Roles + responsibilities**
+- **Aegis (IP & Patent Counsel):** claim framing, filing strategy, risk memos, docket + deadlines, final legal-quality gate
+- **Atlas (Patentability/FTO):** landscape scans, comparator matrices, patentability/FTO opinions, IDS queue inputs
+- **Archivist (Evidence Curator):** Claim↔Spec↔Figure↔Evidence matrix; Evidence Packs; provenance and traceability
+- **Sentinel (Security Reviewer):** disclosure control, sensitive-system red flags, safe-publication gating
+- **Praetor (Privacy Counsel):** DPIA/DPA guidance, lawful basis/retention guidance, privacy sections in specs
+- **Coda (OSS/License Compliance):** SBOMs, license scans, third-party notices, CI compliance gates
+
+**Workflow (repeatable cadence)**
+1) Invention intake (scope + novelty claim + constraints)
+2) Atlas search/landscape → candidate differentiation map
+3) Aegis claim framing (broad core + dependent fallbacks)
+4) Archivist builds traceability matrix + evidence checklist
+5) Sentinel review for disclosure risk (what must not be revealed)
+6) Praetor privacy posture + retention/lawful basis inputs (where relevant)
+7) Coda OSS/license posture (SBOM/notices/gates) (where relevant)
+8) Filing packet assembled + docketed deadlines + post-filing safe narrative plan
+
+## Why it worked
+It turned “smart people doing good work” into an **industrialized pipeline** with clear gates:
+- legal quality (Aegis)
+- novelty and risk clarity (Atlas)
+- traceability and defensibility (Archivist)
+- disclosure safety (Sentinel)
+- compliance completeness (Praetor/Coda)
+
+## Outcome
+- Consistent, filing-grade outputs
+- Lower risk of accidental disclosure
+- Faster iteration because handoffs are explicit
+- Higher confidence in defensibility due to evidence traceability
+
+## Where it landed

+# EVID-0005 — Claim↔Spec↔Figure↔Evidence Matrix Discipline
+
+## Problem
+Strong claims fail if the supporting spec/figures/evidence aren’t mapped cleanly. Without a traceability system, gaps appear late (or during prosecution), and confidence drops.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be usable by both legal and engineering teams
+- Must scale across multiple filings and continuations
+- Must remain auditable and easy to update as product evolves
+
+## Approach
+Archivist maintains a living matrix that maps:
+- **Claim element** → **Spec section(s)** → **Figure(s)** → **Evidence artifact(s)**
+
+**Evidence artifacts include:**
+- logs, manifests, deterministic replay traces (where applicable)
+- screenshots/UX states, API contracts, policy headers
+- benchmark results / latency improvements
+- design docs and implementation notes tied to repo + path
+
+**Operating rules**
+- No claim element is “green” unless it has at least one Spec anchor + one Evidence anchor.
+- Figures are drafted to *teach the examiner* (system flows, method steps, UI states).
+- Every update to claims triggers a matrix update (and vice versa).
+
+## Why it worked
+It converts “we think we support this” into “we can prove we support this,” and it makes missing coverage obvious early.
+
+## Outcome
+- Fewer late-stage rewrites
+- Stronger defensibility posture
+- Cleaner collaboration across legal/engineering/security/compliance
+
+## Where it landed
+IP Pod program discipline (Archivist-led) used for filing packets and continuation planning

+# EVID-0006 — Patch-Kit Strategy (Additive-only / Adapter-first / Feature-flag staged)
+
+## Problem
+Large refactors and “big bang” changes risk breakage, regressions, and loss of confidence—especially in multi-repo systems with interdependencies.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must preserve existing behavior by default
+- Must allow staged rollout and rollback
+- Must be paste-ready and low-risk for Replit workflows
+
+## Approach
+**Patch-Kit principles**
+- **Additive only**: new modules, new routes, new flags—avoid ripping out existing behavior
+- **Adapter-first**: build adapters around existing interfaces before replacing them
+- **Feature-flag staged**: new behavior is gated, toggled on intentionally
+- **Contract-first**: define the interface and expected outputs before wiring deeper
+
+**Deliverable discipline**
+- Provide paste-ready FILE blocks
+- Include post-apply verification checklist
+- Keep diffs minimal and reversible
+
+## Why it worked
+This strategy keeps shipping velocity high while protecting stability. Teams can test safely, compare old vs new, and tighten scope without breaking the baseline.
+
+## Outcome
+- Fewer regressions
+- Faster iteration cycles
+- Higher confidence in “ship” because changes are controlled and testable
+
+## Where it landed
+DreamTeamHub + i³ stack integration work patterns (patch drops, staged rollouts)

+# EVID-0007 — FILE-block Drop Discipline + END_FILE Guardrails
+
+## Problem
+When patch outputs are inconsistent (missing file markers, truncated content, mixed commentary), applying changes becomes error-prone and brittle—especially for automated intake.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be deterministic and machine-applyable
+- Must prevent “junk drops” from entering the pipeline
+- Must remain human-auditable and paste-friendly
+
+## Approach
+**Canonical patch format**
+- Every patch uses explicit:
+  - `FILE: <path>`
+  - content
+  - `END_FILE`
+- Drops are rejected if markers are missing or mismatched.
+
+**Hardening practices**
+- Preflight validation before applying
+- Sanitization/extraction of patch-only blocks when saving
+- Clear error messages when a drop is malformed
+
+## Why it worked
+It reduced ambiguity to near-zero: both humans and tooling can reliably parse and apply changes, and malformed outputs get blocked early.
+
+## Outcome
+- Dramatically fewer apply failures
+- Higher trust in automation
+- Cleaner audit trail (“what changed?” is explicit by file)

+DreamTeamHub / i³ shipping workflow hardening (drop generation + intake/apply gating)

+# EVID-0008 — Three-pass Translation Workflow (Izumi → ChieSan → Kaoru)
+
+## Problem
+JP↔EN translation for theatrical/culturally sensitive work fails when it is treated as “single-pass literal conversion.” Nuance, register, honorifics, and dramaturgical intent require structured review.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must preserve meaning and cultural nuance
+- Must achieve audience readability (not just accuracy)
+- Must keep terminology consistent (glossary discipline)
+- Must not publish without cultural review sign-off when required
+
+## Approach
+**Pass 1 — Izumi (Translator)**
+- Produces publication-grade bilingual output
+- Maintains glossary/terminology consistency
+- Flags ambiguity with translator notes
+
+**Pass 2 — ChieSan (Cultural & Aesthetic Guidance)**
+- Reviews register/honorifics/idioms for cultural correctness
+- Ensures localization choices land naturally
+- Provides cultural sign-off notes
+
+**Pass 3 — Kaoru (Dramaturg)**
+- Polishes for stagecraft accuracy and audience readability
+- Tunes rhythm/intent for performance context
+- Produces final dramaturg-approved script output and adaptation notes
+
+## Why it worked
+It formalized the difference between “correct” and “ready.” The pipeline ensures accuracy, cultural resonance, and stage readability—each validated by the right expert.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher quality and consistency across drafts
+- Reduced rework caused by late-discovered nuance issues
+- Clear sign-off governance for publish readiness
