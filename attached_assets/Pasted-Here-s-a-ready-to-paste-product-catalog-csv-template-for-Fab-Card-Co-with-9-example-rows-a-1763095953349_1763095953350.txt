Here’s a **ready-to-paste** `product_catalog.csv` template for **Fab Card Co** with 9 example rows across **ColorCue, Out Loud, Midnight Express**.

You can literally drop this into a file called `product_catalog.csv` and start testing WO-002.

```csv

### How to use this for WO-002 testing

* Save as `server/data/product_catalog.csv` (or wherever your importer expects it).
* Run your **import script** to load into `product_catalog` table.
* For a WO-002 like:
  `Brand Guidelines – WO-002 ColorCue Birthday Heroes`

  you can:

  * Infer `line = "ColorCue"` from the title,
  * Use `getProductsForLine("ColorCue")` to feed **Lifestyle** and **PDP** packs.

From that point on:

* Lifestyle Pack should only emit SKUs from `SKU-CC-*`.
* PDP/A+ Pack should only write content for those same SKUs.
* Any mismatch (“mentions SKU not in catalog”) can be caught by the Zod refinement we talked about.

If you want, next I can draft an example **WO-002 brief** that explicitly references a subset of these SKUs and describe what the Lifestyle + PDP pack outputs *should* look like when everything is wired correctly.
