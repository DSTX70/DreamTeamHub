PASTE INTO REPO: **Artistic Notation** (Replit repo: `Artistic Notation`)

Interpreting your message canonically as:

* **Broadcast release event: NO (not yet)**
* **DreamTeamHub context selector: YES, but pending an update/spec** (so we’ll **stage it off** until you give the selector contract you want)

Here’s the patch to lock those decisions into config without adding any Broadcast/DTH code yet:

```text
FILE: i3.project.json
{
  "projectKey": "ArtisticNotation",
  "repoSlug": "artistic-notation",
  "integrations": {
    "driveSteward": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "vsuitehqIngest": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "dreamTeamHubContext": {
      "enabled": false,
      "note": "YES requested but pending updated selector contract/spec from DreamTeamHub. Staged OFF."
    },
    "broadcast": {
      "enabled": false,
      "note": "Not yet."
    }
  }
}
END_FILE
```

## Scope / thread placement (canonical)

* Anything that **changes DreamTeamHub UI/selector** is **out of scope** for this DriveSteward root thread and also **not in Artistic Notation**. That work belongs in the **DreamTeamHub thread**.
* Artistic Notation will only need a **small client** once the DTH selector contract is finalized.

### Paste-ready NEW THREAD STARTER (DreamTeamHub selector update)

Use this to start the correct thread for that work:

```text
DreamTeamHub — Repo/Context Selector Update (Canonical)
Confidential and proprietary and copyright Dustin Sparks 2025

PASTE TARGET
- Repo/Replit: DreamTeamHub

GOAL
- Implement/adjust the Repo/Context selector (no BU pages)
- Define the canonical context contract that other repos will follow:
  - projectKey
  - baseUrl (if needed)
  - capabilities (ops routing)
  - persistence (local storage key + schema)

REQUEST
1) Current selector location (route/component paths)
2) Desired repos list (including ArtisticNotation)
3) Any capability flags required per repo
4) Definition of Done: selector persists + drives routing cleanly

OUTPUT REQUIRED
- Single FILE:…END_FILE patch drop
- MUST state: “PASTE INTO REPO: DreamTeamHub”
```

When you’re ready with the updated selector requirements, drop them in that DreamTeamHub thread and I’ll produce the patch drop there.
