✅ Awesome — that closes the loop on the *actual* confusing page.

Here’s what I recommend doing **right now** to “lock” this improvement so it doesn’t drift, and so the Audit implementation can be considered fully completed.

---

## 1) Add an Evidence Pack + Decision (so this UX win is preserved)

This belongs in **DreamTeamHub repo** under heritage canon.

### Patch: EVID + Decision + index updates

+# EVID-0059 — Templates Page UX Clarification (Default Calm, Pro Power)
+
+## Problem
+Users confused Work Orders (templates/runbooks) with active work, because the page visually resembled execution (runs/cost/stats) and used “work” language.
+
+## Constraints
+- No schema changes
+- Keep Pro power available
+- Default users must immediately understand the mental model without explanation
+
+## Approach
+**Default mode (calm templates library)**
+- Intro card: “Work Orders are templates/runbooks. Active execution lives in Work Items.”
+- Prominent CTAs: “Go to Work” (/work) and “New Work” (/intent)
+- Rename labels to template language:
+  - “Create Template”
+  - “Available Templates”
+  - “Run Template”
+- Per-row “Template” badge to reinforce meaning
+
+**Pro/Advanced (additive)**
+- Show/Hide Advanced toggle reveals:
+  - caps, KPIs, playbook, and runs table
+- Keeps power without confusing default users
+
+## Why it worked
+It separated “library” from “execution” visually and linguistically, while preserving advanced capabilities behind an explicit toggle.
+
+## Outcome
+- Default users no longer mistake templates for active work
+- Pro users retain full visibility into template internals and run history
+- Reduced workflow friction and onboarding confusion
+
+## Where it landed
+DreamTeamHub: `client/src/pages/work-orders.tsx` Templates UI

+# Decision: DTH-20251226-057 — Templates Page Must Be Calm by Default; Advanced Details Are Optional
+**Date:** 2025-12-26
+**Status:** Locked
+
+## Decision
+Work Orders are presented as Templates/runbooks with a calm default view; advanced details (caps/KPIs/runs/debug) are hidden unless explicitly expanded (or Pro).
+
+## Rationale
+Prevents templates being mistaken for active work while preserving power.

## 2) Refresh the scoreboard in one command

Now that you’ve made more canon updates, run:

```bash
npm run heritage:status
```

and then optionally:

```bash
npm run heritage:index:sync
```

(That ensures indexes remain deterministic.)

---

## 3) Final Audit “Definition of Done” check (we can stamp it)

If these are true, the Audit implementation is complete for this thread:

* ✅ `/work` shows active work (Work Items) with context + cast
* ✅ Templates page clearly says “templates” and points to Work + Intent
* ✅ Pro adds power without changing meaning
* ✅ Target Context is visible at-a-glance on Work page
* ✅ No schema changes required

If you want, I’ll provide a one-paragraph **Audit Closeout Stamp** you can paste into your project log (and/or add as a Heritage decision note).
