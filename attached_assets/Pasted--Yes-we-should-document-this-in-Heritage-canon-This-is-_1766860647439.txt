✅ Yes — we should **document this in Heritage canon**. This is a foundational “nervous system” win and it needs to be **evidence-grade** so it never drifts.

Below is a **paste-ready Replit drop** for **DreamTeamHub** that adds:

* **EVID-0060** — Strategy→Lock→Convert→Work execution pipeline
* **Decision DTH-20251226-058** — Lock-first rule enforced + conversion contract
* Index updates for `_EVIDENCE_INDEX.json` and `_DECISION_INDEX.json`
* New skill: `strategy_to_execution_pipeline`

+# EVID-0060 — Strategy→Lock→Convert→Work Pipeline (Approval-First Execution)
+
+## Problem
+Brainstorming in chat is powerful but not durable: history, dissent, and refinement are hard to preserve and audit. Execution can also drift without a hard “lock” gate.
+
+## Constraints
+- Strategy must be first-class, persistent, and auditable in DTH
+- No execution artifacts may be created without explicit lock
+- Dustin Sparks remains sole approval authority
+- Must preserve the full strategy context into the Work Item
+- No schema changes required
+
+## Approach
+**Flow**
+1) Create Strategy Session (NON-EXECUTING)
+2) Iterate + refine → Save
+3) Lock Direction (Status → LOCKED)
+4) Convert to Work Item (enabled only when LOCKED)
+5) Work page shows active execution (Work Items)
+
+**Enforced gate**
+- Convert to Work Item is disabled while Strategy status is OPEN
+- Lock is required before conversion is allowed
+
+**Conversion payload preserves provenance**
+- title: derived from Strategy title (work item naming)
+- owner: Strategy author
+- inputs: full Strategy markdown body (entire thinking artifact)
+- output/playbook fields: include provenance (strategySessionId, locked timestamp, repo hint) to preserve traceability
+
+## Why it worked
+It made “thinking” a durable artifact, and made approval enforceable (not implied). Execution becomes a controlled downstream step.
+
+## Outcome
+- Full end-to-end workflow operational:
+  Intent → Strategy (debate) → Lock Direction → Convert to Work Item → Work (execute)
+- Clear audit trail of what was approved and what was executed
+- Reduced risk of premature drops or silent execution
+
+## Where it landed
+DreamTeamHub Strategy Sessions + Work Items conversion flow (UI + API)

+# Decision: DTH-20251226-058 — Strategy Must Be LOCKED Before Converting to Work Item
+**Date:** 2025-12-26
+**Status:** Locked
+
+## Decision
+Strategy Sessions are NON-EXECUTING. A Strategy must be explicitly **LOCKED** before it can be converted into a Work Item. Conversion must carry the full strategy artifact and provenance into the Work Item fields.
+
+## Rationale
+Enforces approval-first execution and preserves an auditable trail from thinking → approval → execution.

## Optional tiny feature I’d add next (high ROI, low risk)

If you want one more improvement that makes this feel “complete”:

**On the Work Item detail page:** show a small badge like
**“Seeded from Strategy Session: {id}”** with a link back to `/strategy/{id}`.

That would close the provenance loop visually.

If you tell me the Work Item detail page file path (or paste the top of it), I’ll drop a patch for that too.
