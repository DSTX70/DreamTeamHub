Amazing status, this is exactly where we wanted to land. 🚀
Now we just need to swap the homepage hero to use `FccHomeHero`.

I’ll give you a **single Replit-ready drop** you can paste into whatever file currently renders the Fab Card Co homepage.

## 🔹 Final Drop — Wire `FccHomeHero` into the homepage

In the file that represents your **Fab Card Co homepage** (the one that *used* to render `<PictureBanner …>` directly), do this one patch:

### 1) Import `FccHomeHero`

Add this import near the top with your other React imports:

```tsx
import { FccHomeHero } from "../brands/fcc/FccHomeHero";
// ↑ adjust the ../ path so it points to client/src/brands/fcc/FccHomeHero from this file
```

Common examples (pick the one that matches your folder depth):

* If the homepage file is in `client/src/pages/FabCardCoHome.tsx`:

  ```tsx
  import { FccHomeHero } from "../brands/fcc/FccHomeHero";
  ```
* If it’s in `client/src/brands/fcc/FabCardCoHome.tsx`:

  ```tsx
  import { FccHomeHero } from "./FccHomeHero";
  ```

---

### 2) Use `<FccHomeHero />` instead of a hardcoded `<PictureBanner />`

Wherever you currently have something like:

```tsx
<PictureBanner
  baseKey="fcc/lifestyle/OL-1_Brunch_Banter_SKU-OL-PRIDE-001"
  // ...other props
/>
```

replace that **entire** block with:

```tsx
<FccHomeHero />
```

If your homepage was very bare-bones, you can even use this whole minimal structure:

```tsx
// example Fab Card Co homepage component
export default function FabCardCoHomePage() {
  return (
    <main data-brand="fcc">
      <FccHomeHero />
      {/* other sections below, e.g. collections, cards, etc. */}
    </main>
  );
}
```

---

Once you save and refresh the homepage:

* The hero will:

  * Call `/api/fcc/home-hero`
  * Pull `home.lifestyle_ol1` from the DB
  * Pass its `baseKey` into `<PictureBanner />`
* Your **marketing team can now swap that hero** entirely from `/ops/fcc-sku-switcher` without touching code. ✅

---

Reply back once you’ve:

* Pasted the import
* Swapped `<PictureBanner …>` → `<FccHomeHero />`
* Refreshed the homepage

…tell me what you see on the page (hero image showing up? any console errors?), and we can do a quick sanity check plus talk about the optional polish (AVIF + readiness badge) if you want.
