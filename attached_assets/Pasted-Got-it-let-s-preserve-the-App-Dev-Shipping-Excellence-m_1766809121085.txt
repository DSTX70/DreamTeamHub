Got it — let’s preserve the **App Dev Shipping Excellence** machine the same way: **evidence-grade canon**, **decisions**, and **indexes** (additive; no schema changes).

Below is the **5-pack**:

* **EVID-0019** — DriveSteward as the artifact spine (publish-history + intake governance)
* **EVID-0020** — VSuiteHQ ingest receipts (drop vs recommendation + metadata)
* **EVID-0021** — Broadcast release events (release narrative + ecosystem signal)
* **EVID-0022** — Deterministic verification after ship (runtime truth, not “passes”)
* **EVID-0023** — Per-drop status badges (Validate / Apply / Ship / Verify) as work visibility

…and the matching decisions **DTH-20251226-017 → 021**, plus updates to the two index files.

+# EVID-0019 — DriveSteward as the Shipping Artifact Spine (Intake + Publish-History)
+
+## Problem
+Shipping pipelines lose trust when artifacts are scattered, outcomes aren’t traceable, and “what shipped?” can’t be answered deterministically.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be a single source of truth for artifacts and history
+- Must be auditable (who/what/when/where)
+- Must not allow risky execution paths through intake (governance)
+- Must support “publish-history” queries for downstream systems
+
+## Approach
+DriveSteward functions as the artifact spine:
+1) **Intake governance**
+   - Intake paths are treated as storage/organization, not execution
+   - “No execution from intake paths” is enforced via policy/CI guardrails (where applicable)
+2) **Publish-history API**
+   - Shipping actions record structured receipts (validate/apply/ship/verify)
+   - History can be queried by projectKey/repoSlug/workItemId/dropId
+3) **Artifact indexing**
+   - Every ship produces a receipt and indexed artifacts (drops, manifests, verification)
+
+## Why it worked
+It made “shipping” evidence-grade: you can point to a receipt, find the exact artifact, and prove what happened without relying on memory.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher confidence in the pipeline
+- Faster debugging and rollback
+- Clear lineage of changes and results
+
+## Where it landed
+i³ stack execution: DriveSteward intake + publish-history as a canonical record
+
+## Related Skills

+
+# EVID-0020 — VSuiteHQ Ingest Integration (Receipts + Result Classification)
+
+## Problem
+Teams need proof that work outputs are stored and discoverable. Without ingest receipts, “it ran” doesn’t equal “it’s accessible.”
+
+## Constraints
+- Must preserve outcome metadata (ok/failed, ids, storage type)
+- Must support “drop” vs “recommendation” storage semantics
+- Must not disrupt baseline execution paths
+
+## Approach
+**Ingest as a first-class optional step**
+- Execution can run normally OR run with ingest enabled.
+- When ingest is enabled, results are pushed to VSuiteHQ and return structured metadata such as:
+  - ok: true/false
+  - dropId
+  - storedAs: "drop" | "recommendation"
+
+**Receipt discipline**
+- Store ingest status as a machine-readable receipt alongside other ship steps.
+- UI surfaces results without requiring manual copying.
+
+## Why it worked
+It replaced “trust me” with receipts. Outputs became searchable, reusable, and attributable.
+
+## Outcome
+- Clear confirmation that results landed in VSuiteHQ
+- Reduced manual copy/paste and lost work
+- Better lifecycle tracking across Work Items and Drops
+
+## Where it landed
+DreamTeamHub execution → VSuiteHQ ingest pipeline

+
+# EVID-0021 — Broadcast Release Events (Ecosystem Signal Without Manual Comms)
+
+## Problem
+Shipping changes across an ecosystem needs coordinated visibility. Without a broadcast event, teams learn about changes late, or not at all.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be optional and non-blocking
+- Must emit a consistent event payload (projectKey/repoSlug/version/notes)
+- Must not require manual announcement steps to be effective
+
+## Approach
+**Broadcast release event on ship (optional)**
+- When enabled, ship triggers a release event to Broadcast Hub
+- Event includes identifiers and a summary suitable for dashboards/feeds
+- Secrets/env are handled as configuration, not hardcoded behavior
+
+## Why it worked
+It “closes the loop” between shipping and awareness—making the ecosystem feel coordinated rather than fragmented.
+
+## Outcome
+- Faster awareness across teams
+- Reduced “what changed?” confusion
+- Cleaner release narratives tied to actual shipments
+
+## Where it landed
+i³ ship pipeline → Broadcast Hub release events

+# EVID-0022 — Deterministic Verification After Ship (Runtime Truth)
+
+## Problem
+Pipelines can report “pass” while the live URL hasn’t actually changed. Without runtime verification, teams lose confidence in automation.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must verify against runtime (HTTP, endpoint match, artifact presence)
+- Must produce machine-readable verify results
+- Must surface verify outcomes clearly in the UI (human trust)
+
+## Approach
+**Post-ship verify step**
+- Verification runs after ship and checks real runtime signals (e.g., HTTP match)
+- Stores a structured result (ok/kind/matched/metadata)
+
+**Work visibility**
+- The raw verify JSON is preserved for audit
+- A UI-level badge/banner summarizes the state for fast understanding
+
+## Why it worked
+It prevents “false confidence” by grounding success in runtime evidence.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher trust in ship pipeline
+- Faster detection of “ship succeeded but deploy didn’t”
+- Clearer debugging paths (verify result points to what failed)
+
+## Where it landed
+i³ shipping pipeline: post-ship deterministic verification + UI surfacing

+# EVID-0023 — Per-drop Status Badges (Validate / Apply / Ship / Verify) = Work Visibility
+
+## Problem
+Users can’t tell what happened to a change without drilling into logs. “Work visibility” requires at-a-glance status across pipeline stages.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must persist status per drop (not only for selected item)
+- Must keep raw JSON receipts while showing simple badges
+- Must be consistent across UI surfaces (dropdown rows, detail pages)
+
+## Approach
+**Persist per-stage receipts**
+- For each drop, store summaries for:
+  - VALIDATED ✅/❌
+  - APPLIED ✅/❌
+  - SHIPPED ✅/❌
+  - VERIFY ✅/❌
+- Keep the full underlying JSON payload available for audit
+
+**Render per-row badges**
+- Show badges directly in drop lists (not only on a selected drop)
+- “Next actions” deep-link to the right filtered views when failures occur
+
+## Why it worked
+It reduced cognitive load: users can see pipeline state instantly and jump to the right next step without hunting.
+
+## Outcome
+- Faster triage and recovery
+- Less confusion about “did it actually ship?”
+- Higher trust and adoption of the workflow
+
+## Where it landed
+DreamTeamHub work visibility patterns (drop lists + receipts + next actions)

If you want the “single scoreboard” summary updated too, next we can add a tiny `canon/heritage/STATUS.md` that auto-documents totals (evidence count + decision count + last updated date) so you never have to recount by hand.
