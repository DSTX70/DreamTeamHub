Love this part—this is where the JSON turns into real work your humans (or image engines) can do.

I’ll keep it tight and practical:
For each of the **4 brand/creative packs**, here’s **exactly which fields matter** and **how to use them** for designers + devs.

---

## 1) Packaging & Pre-Press Pack

**Who:** Nova / packaging vendors / devs wiring downloadable dielines

Look for in JSON:

* `summary` / `packaging_story`

  * **Use:** One-paragraph blurb you drop at the top of a packaging brief or email to the printer:

    > “This line should feel like X; hero color is Y; it sits next to Z on shelf.”

* `primary_formats[]`
  For each entry:

  * `name` → “5x7 card box”, “Mug box”, “Display sleeve”
  * `dimensions_mm { width, height, depth }` → spec for your dieline
  * `orientation` → portrait / landscape / square
  * `notes` → anything special (window cutouts, handle, etc.)
    **Use:**
  * Designer: choose correct template, set artboard size, layout thinking.
  * Vendor: exact finished size + fold depth.

* `print_specs`

  * `color_mode` → CMYK or CMYK+PMS
  * `coatings[]` → matte / gloss / soft_touch / UV / spot_uv
  * `special_finishes[]` → foil / emboss / glitter etc.
  * `stock` → weight, finish, base color
    **Use:**
  * Hand this block directly to printer / production manager.
  * Designer uses it to know “Can I assume foil? Matte only? White stock or cream stock?”

* `compliance_checklist[]`

  * `label` + `requirement` (“UPC barcode on bottom”, “Country of origin near logo”, “Age warning on back”).
    **Use:**
  * QA checklist before sending final art.
  * Dev (if you show packaging on site) can make sure imagery doesn’t remove required marks.

* `prepress_checklist[]`

  * Stepwise tasks like “Verify bleed,” “Convert text to outlines,” “Export CMYK PDF/X-1a.”
    **Use:**
  * Your final pre-flight list in Figma/Illustrator and in your internal wiki.

## 2) Product Line Architecture & SKU Tree Pack

**Who:** Nova / Ops / devs setting up SKUs, navigation & filters

Look for in JSON:

* `line_name`, `line_code_prefix`
  **Use:**

  * Top-level collection name and SKU prefix (`ME`, `CC`, etc.).
  * Dev: base slug or key for this line.

* `hierarchy[]`

  * Each object:

    * `collection` → e.g. “Midnight Express”, “ColorCue”
    * `series[]` → e.g. “Elegant Evening”, “Joyful Day”

      * Each `products[]` → title / description

        * Each `variants[]` →

          * `sku`
          * `attributes` (size, finish, format, etc.)
          * `msrp`, `wholesale`, `tier`
            **Use:**
  * Designers: know which cards belong to which hero / series (so visuals stay coherent).
  * Devs:

    * set up products + variants exactly per this tree,
    * generate site filters (“Series”, “Finish”, “Occasion”) from `attributes`.

* `roadmap_phases[]`

  * `phase_name`, `phase_order`, `included_skus[]`
    **Use:**
  * Decide which SKUs go live in this **hero update** vs held for later.

    * `hero` → top banner
    * `feature_grid` → 3/4-up feature tiles
    * `story` → lifestyle panel
  * Image team uses `image_ideas` plus Lifestyle Pack for the actual shots.

### How to brief the team in practice

Once these four show up for **WO-001**, you can make a super straightforward hand-off:

* **Lifestyle Pack →**

  * Image prompts, filenames, SKUs, alt-text/SEO meta seeds.
* **Product Line & SKU Tree →**

  * Which SKUs exist, how they roll up into collections/series, what goes live first.
* **E-Com PDP & A+ →**

  * PDP fields (title, subtitle, bullets, description, FAQs) + A+ wireframe content.
* **Social Campaign & Calendar →**

  * 30-day content plan with hooks, CTAs, and asset requirements.

If you want, tell me one specific SKU from that Lifestyle JSON (e.g. `SKU-ME-ELEGANT-001`) and I’ll turn *that one row* into:

* Final hero image prompt
* `<img>` filename + alt text
* PDP title + description snippet
* One Instagram caption + hashtag set

so your team has a concrete “this is how we use the packs” example.
