+# EVID-0009 — Brand Lock Governance System (No Unapproved Variants)
+
+## Problem
+Brand quality drifts when palettes/fonts/logos/voice “almost match” but aren’t canonical. Over time, variants multiply, trust erodes, and teams waste cycles debating aesthetics instead of shipping.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must preserve exact brand decisions across many brands/lines
+- Must be audit-friendly (what is “approved” is explicit)
+- Must prevent silent drift (“close enough” variants)
+- Must enable safe iteration (explicit change control, not ad hoc)
+
+## Approach
+**Brand Lock = Canon + Enforcement**
+1) **Canonical Assets**
+   - One official logo lockup per brand/line (plus explicitly allowed variants)
+   - Locked color palette(s) (hex codes)
+   - Locked typography system (fonts + roles)
+   - Locked tone/voice attributes + “do/don’t” copy rules
+2) **Change Control**
+   - Version + date stamped updates
+   - Change log entries for any modifications
+   - No retroactive edits without change log entry
+3) **Enforcement Rules**
+   - “No unapproved variants” is the default rule
+   - If an asset/spec isn’t in canon, it is treated as **not approved**
+   - Outputs must reference canon (explicitly or implicitly through the locked system)
+4) **Execution Discipline**
+   - Exports include correct specs/sizes where defined
+   - Templates are reused (avoid new “near matches”)
+   - If blocked (missing canonical asset), stop and list blockers (do not invent)
+
+## Why it worked
+It transformed “brand taste” into a deterministic system: fewer debates, higher consistency, faster shipping, and stronger trust in deliverables.
+
+## Outcome
+- Visual + voice consistency across brands and lines
+- Lower drift and fewer “mystery variants”
+- Faster production because rework is reduced
+
+## Where it landed
+Portfolio-wide brand governance: Fab Card Co + dreamshitter.com + fabulousAF + TFBC + FabulousGram

+# EVID-0010 — dreamshitter.com Brand Lock (Name Visibility + Character + Accent Colors)
+
+## Problem
+Satirical brands lose impact when the name is inconsistently applied, mascots drift off-model, and product/packaging visuals become incoherent across channels.
+
+## Constraints
+- The full brand name **dreamshitter.com** must remain visible as a brand anchor
+- Mascot illustration must stay on-model (approved reference poses/palette)
+- Accent colors must be used intentionally and sparingly
+- No unapproved variants or “close enough” redraws
+
+## Approach (Locked Rules)
+1) **Name Visibility Rule**
+   - The full brand name **dreamshitter.com** must be included across branding/product design/copy/packaging
+   - Products must include the full brand name on at least one visible side/location when used
+2) **Character Governance (Ronald a.k.a. Crumbles)**
+   - Use approved palettes + official reference poses
+   - Avoid unapproved facial styles and unapproved “flames” treatments
+3) **Accent Colors**
+   - Acid Yellow `#FFD437` and Gold Beige `#EEC95B` are approved accent colors
+   - Use sparingly and with intent (not as dominant fills unless explicitly designed)
+4) **Tone**
+   - Satirical, sharp, comedic — but brand-consistent (avoid random edginess that breaks voice)
+
+## Why it worked
+The brand stays instantly recognizable (name + mascot), and humor scales across products without visual chaos.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher brand recall (name + mascot consistency)
+- Fewer off-model assets
+- Cleaner product line coherence across merch and packaging
+
+## Where it landed

+# EVID-0011 — Fab Card Co Brand System Lock (Parent Brand + Collections + Format Rules)
+
+## Problem
+Multi-line greeting card brands drift when each collection invents its own look/voice, breaking the parent identity and creating inconsistent product quality.
+
+## Constraints
+- Parent brand identity must remain stable
+- Each collection has a locked palette/typography/voice
+- Collection identity must not be “blended” unless explicitly approved
+- Format/template standards must be respected (avoid ad hoc layouts)
+
+## Approach (Locked System)
+**Parent Brand (Fab Card Co.)**
+- Tagline: *Artfully Said. Beautifully Delivered.*
+- Subline: *Because how you say it matters.*
+- Voice: Bold, Inclusive, Witty, Emotional, Modern
+- Enforce locked palettes/typography choices as defined in canon
+
+**Approved Collections (locked)**
+1) ColorCue (including the rule: always written as “ColorCue”)
+2) HeartScript
+3) Midnight Express
+4) The Remix Collection
+5) Out Loud
+
+**Collection governance**
+- Each line uses its approved style board (palette + typography + mood)
+- No “near match” fonts/colors
+- Use the approved mockup/templates (including 2-up standards where specified)
+
+**Format rules captured as canon**
+- Remix Collection: square format direction and layout standards
+- Midnight Express: upscale, tone-on-tone black with glitter/foil accents; holiday-focused direction
+- Out Loud: approved logo lockup and format rotation mix as defined in canon
+
+## Why it worked
+It allowed creativity inside safe boundaries: each line feels distinct, but the whole brand remains coherent and premium.
+
+## Outcome
+- Consistent quality across collections
+- Faster design decisions (rules are already chosen)
+- Reduced brand confusion between lines
+
+## Where it landed
+Fab Card Co. brand bible + collection style boards + mockup/template standards

+# EVID-0012 — fabulousAF™ Brand Lock (Logo + Tagline Lockup)
+
+## Problem
+Signature brands lose recognition when logo styling and tagline presentation drift across merch, web, and campaign assets.
+
+## Constraints
+- Use the approved logo styling and tagline lockup only
+- Do not invent new lockups, colors, or placements without approval
+- Maintain consistent voice and punch
+
+## Approach (Locked Elements)
+- **Logo:** fabulousAF™ (fabulous lowercase, AF uppercase) with the approved color treatment
+- **Tagline:** “I am. You are. We are.” displayed on the approved red brushstroke background
+
+**Usage governance**
+- Treat the lockup as canonical across merchandise, web, and campaigns
+- If a size/layout variant is required, it must be an approved derivative (not an invented redesign)
+
+## Why it worked
+The lockup is the identity. By freezing it, the brand stays instantly recognizable while everything else can evolve around it.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher recall and consistency across touchpoints
+- Less rework and fewer “almost right” versions
+
+## Where it landed

+# EVID-0013 — The Fabulous Brand Company + FabulousGram Brand Governance (Channel Layer Without Drift)
+
+## Problem
+When a “delivery channel brand” (like a digital card/distribution layer) is layered over multiple collections/brands, it can accidentally override or dilute the underlying brand locks.
+
+## Constraints
+- Channel layer must not rewrite collection identity
+- Voice/tone must remain consistent with the originating brand/collection
+- No unapproved variants introduced through “templates” or “distribution formats”
+
+## Approach
+**House brand governance (TFBC)**
+- Maintain portfolio-level governance rules (versioning, change logs, and locked playbooks where required)
+- Preserve system updates with explicit version/date increments where mandated (no silent edits)
+
+**FabulousGram as a channel layer**
+- FabulousGram behaves as a **distribution wrapper**, not a rebrand:
+  - It carries the originating line’s palette/typography/voice
+  - It may add metadata/format constraints, but does not alter identity
+- Any “template” used for FabulousGram must be derived from canonical brand templates (no new near-matches)
+
+## Why it worked
+It kept the ecosystem cohesive: distribution increased reach without accidentally producing off-brand assets.
+
+## Outcome
+- Stronger cross-brand consistency
+- Lower brand drift across digital channels
+- Cleaner governance and auditability
+
+## Where it landed
+The Fabulous Brand Company governance + FabulousGram channel strategy rules

## Post-apply verification (DreamTeamHub)

1. Confirm new evidence files exist:

* `canon/heritage/evidence/EVID-0009.md`
* `canon/heritage/evidence/EVID-0010.md`
* `canon/heritage/evidence/EVID-0011.md`
* `canon/heritage/evidence/EVID-0012.md`
* `canon/heritage/evidence/EVID-0013.md`

2. Open `canon/heritage/decision-log.md` and confirm decisions `DTH-20251226-007` → `011`.

3. Confirm `canon/heritage/skills.json` parses cleanly.

---

If you want the “brand lock canon” to be even more enforceable, next step is to add **brand-specific “do not change” checklists** (1 page each) under `canon/heritage/brandlocks/`—but the above 5-pack is already enough to preserve the *exact rules + tone constraints + no-variants posture* as evidence-grade canon.
