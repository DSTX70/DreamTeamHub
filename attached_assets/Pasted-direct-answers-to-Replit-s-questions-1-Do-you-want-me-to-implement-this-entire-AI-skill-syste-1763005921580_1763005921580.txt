direct answers to Replit’s questions 👇

1️⃣ “Do you want me to implement this entire AI skill system now?”

Yes — but scoped.

For now, implement just the Lifestyle Pack path, using the pattern we set up:

You should:

Add the schemas (Zod):

LifestylePackSchema + types (we already dropped this)

Keep Patent/Launch schemas in the repo, but you only have to wire Lifestyle right now if you want to keep it small.

Add the endpoint:

POST /api/work-items/:id/actions/generate-lifestyle-pack

Use the generic handler pattern we defined:

// with createWorkItemActionHandler
app.post(
  "/api/work-items/:id/actions/generate-lifestyle-pack",
  postGenerateLifestylePack
);


postGenerateLifestylePack should be the thin wrapper that passes:

skillName: "generateLifestyleBannerPack"

outputSchema: LifestylePackSchema

persist: saveLifestylePackArtifacts

Hook into the existing LLM infra:

Yes: this should use your existing runSkill / Work Orders LLM execution.

Treat generateLifestyleBannerPack as just another skill:

runSkill({ skillName, input }) with the system_prompt + JSON schema we already defined.

You do not have to fully wire Patent Claims / Launch Plan packs right now. Those can be turned on later using the same pattern.

2️⃣ “What about the actual images?”

Short version:

The hero will only show images once files exist at:

fcc/lifestyle/OL-1_Brunch_Banter_SKU-OL-PRIDE-001_1920x800.webp

fcc/lifestyle/OL-1_Brunch_Banter_SKU-OL-PRIDE-001_960x600.webp

fcc/lifestyle/OL-1_Brunch_Banter_SKU-OL-PRIDE-001_1080x1350.webp

Right now those keys 404 → hence naturalWidth === 0 and “pending upload”.

For this sprint, I’d like you to:

✅ Add placeholder/test images to S3 at those exact keys so we can see /fcc working end-to-end.

That means:

Use any neutral hero placeholder (even a simple gradient or stock photo) and upload via whatever path your Ops → Images / S3 uploader expects.

The important part is: filenames match the export plan.

Later:

The AI Lifestyle Pack skill will give Nova/Storybloom the full spec.

Final art replaces the placeholders, using the same filenames, so the app doesn’t change—only the pixels do.

So: go with Option 1 Replit proposed — upload placeholders so we can see the hero live now, then let the AI-generated specs drive the real assets later.

3️⃣ “Should this hook into runSkill / Work Orders LLM system?”

Yes, exactly.

This is not a separate one-off.

It should plug into the same LLM action pathway described in replit.md:

Same runSkill function

Same way you load skill configs (like generateLifestyleBannerPack.json)

Same logging/telemetry as your other skills

Think of generateLifestyleBannerPack as:

“A Work Item → Pack-style skill that reads the WI, calls the LLM, returns a typed pack object, and persists it.”

No new infra, just:

New skill config

New schema

New endpoint that uses the same plumbing.

Suggested concrete next steps for Replit

If you want something you can paste into a “comment to Replit” or a task list, here’s a tight version:

Please proceed with:

Implementing the Lifestyle Pack skill only:

Add LifestylePackSchema and types (from our spec).

Add POST /api/work-items/:id/actions/generate-lifestyle-pack using createWorkItemActionHandler + runSkill("generateLifestyleBannerPack", …).

Wiring it into the existing Work Orders LLM system:

Use the same runSkill pattern as other skills; load the system prompt + output schema from config.

Uploading three placeholder OL-1 hero images to S3 at:

fcc/lifestyle/OL-1_Brunch_Banter_SKU-OL-PRIDE-001_1920x800.webp

fcc/lifestyle/OL-1_Brunch_Banter_SKU-OL-PRIDE-001_960x600.webp

fcc/lifestyle/OL-1_Brunch_Banter_SKU-OL-PRIDE-001_1080x1350.webp
so /fcc shows a non-placeholder lifestyle hero while we iterate.

Patent/Launch packs can be wired later using the same pattern; focus on Lifestyle first.
