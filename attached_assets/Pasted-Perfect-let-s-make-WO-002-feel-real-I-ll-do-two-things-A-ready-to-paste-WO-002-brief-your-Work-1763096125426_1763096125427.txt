Perfect, let’s make WO-002 feel real.

I’ll do two things:

A ready-to-paste WO-002 brief (your Work Item body in DTH).

A clear picture of what Lifestyle + PDP packs should output when wired to the product_catalog.csv we just defined.

1️⃣ Example WO-002 Brief (Work Item Body)

You can paste this markdown straight into the Description/body of a new WI:

## WO-002 – ColorCue Birthday & Thank You Homepage Heroes

### Objective

Design and implement updated homepage hero images and supporting PDP content for a focused set of **ColorCue** SKUs, using the existing Fab Card Co. brand system.

This Work Item should produce:

- Lifestyle hero image specs for the selected SKUs  
- Aligned PDP & A+ content for those same SKUs  
- Clear mapping from each hero slot to a real SKU in the product catalog  
- Ready-to-use copy and filenames that can be wired into the website

### In-Scope Line & SKUs

**Line:** ColorCue  
**Focus:** Birthday + Thank You

These SKUs must be treated as the source of truth (no invented SKUs):

1. `SKU-CC-BDAY-001` – Birthday Remix – Neon Confetti  
2. `SKU-CC-BDAY-002` – Soft Surprise – Pastel Sprinkles  
3. `SKU-CC-THANK-001` – Grateful Waves  

These exist in `product_catalog.csv` with their canonical `product_name`, `collection`, `series`, `url_slug`, and `hero_slot`.

### Hero Strategy

We want a small, coherent hero set that showcases ColorCue’s range:

- **Hero 1 – Bold Birthday (SKU-CC-BDAY-001)**  
  - Feeling: energetic, bright, “party in motion”  
  - Visual: neon confetti, bold color play, strong contrast  
  - Slot: `home-hero-1`

- **Hero 2 – Soft Birthday (SKU-CC-BDAY-002)**  
  - Feeling: warm, tender, pastel and cozy  
  - Visual: soft-focus backgrounds, pastel sprinkles, gentle light  
  - Slot: `home-hero-2`

- **Hero 3 – Thank You (SKU-CC-THANK-001)**  
  - Feeling: modern, calm gratitude  
  - Visual: simple, graphic, hints of grid / wave geometry  
  - Slot: `thankyou-hero-1`

### Lifestyle Pack Expectations

The **Lifestyle Banner Pack** should:

- Only reference SKUs that exist in the product catalog and are listed above  
- For each in-scope SKU, propose:
  - A specific hero use (slot)
  - A consistent, KDP-/web-friendly filename pattern
  - Meta title, description, and focus keywords

Each lifestyle hero spec should be safe to hand directly to:

- Designers (for art direction)  
- Devs (for filenames + mapping to hero slots)  
- SEO (for titles / descriptions / keywords)

### PDP & A+ Content Expectations

The **E-Com PDP & A+ Content Pack** should:

- Generate PDP copy **only** for these three SKUs  
- Respect the canonical `product_name` and `url_slug` from the catalog  
- Provide:
  - SEO-aware titles and slugs
  - A short subtitle that matches ColorCue’s tone
  - 3–7 feature/benefit bullets per SKU
  - A long description aligned with the Lifestyle hero mood
  - A+ sections with headings, body copy, and image ideas that can reuse Lifestyle hero assets where appropriate
  - A short FAQ set that addresses likely objections for these card types

This WO does **not** need to cover pricing logic, discounts, or multi-pack bundles; focus on core PDP presentation for individual cards.

### Constraints & Notes

- Do **not** invent new SKUs or product names; if the brief mentions something not found in `product_catalog`, treat it as out of scope and flag it in your notes.
- Maintain ColorCue’s approved brand voice: bold, inclusive, witty, emotional, modern.
- Avoid generic filler copy; each SKU’s PDP should feel distinct and emotionally specific.


That’s your WO-002 kickoff spec.

2️⃣ What the Lifestyle Pack Output Should Look Like (When Wired Correctly)

Once Lifestyle is hooked into product_catalog and respects the “don’t invent SKUs” rule, its payload for WO-002 should look something like this (conceptually):

{
  "summary": "Lifestyle hero specs for ColorCue Birthday and Thank You cards.",
  "entries": [
    {
      "sku": "SKU-CC-BDAY-001",
      "hero_slot": "home-hero-1",
      "filename": "fcc/lifestyle/colorcue_home-hero-1_SKU-CC-BDAY-001_1920x800.webp",
      "meta_title": "Birthday Remix – Neon Confetti | ColorCue Birthday Card",
      "meta_description": "A bold, neon confetti birthday card from ColorCue that turns any celebration into a party remix.",
      "focus_keywords": [
        "birthday card",
        "neon confetti",
        "colorful greeting card",
        "ColorCue"
      ],
      "visual_direction": "Bright, high-energy birthday scene with neon confetti, bold geometric shapes, and a clear focal card. Cinematic 1920x800 crop with safe space on left/right for headlines.",
      "notes": "Use ColorCue brand palette; avoid cluttered backgrounds so the card art remains the hero."
    },
    {
      "sku": "SKU-CC-BDAY-002",
      "hero_slot": "home-hero-2",
      "filename": "fcc/lifestyle/colorcue_home-hero-2_SKU-CC-BDAY-002_1920x800.webp",
      "meta_title": "Soft Surprise – Pastel Sprinkles | ColorCue Birthday Card",
      "meta_description": "A warm pastel birthday card from ColorCue with soft, celebratory sprinkles and gentle light.",
      "focus_keywords": [
        "pastel birthday card",
        "soft greeting card",
        "ColorCue birthday"
      ],
      "visual_direction": "Soft-focus tabletop or mantle scene with pastel sprinkles, warm ambient light, and a single featured card in the foreground. 1920x800 hero crop.",
      "notes": "Lean into creamy backgrounds and gentle gradients; avoid harsh shadows or high contrast."
    },
    {
      "sku": "SKU-CC-THANK-001",
      "hero_slot": "thankyou-hero-1",
      "filename": "fcc/lifestyle/colorcue_thankyou-hero-1_SKU-CC-THANK-001_1920x800.webp",
      "meta_title": "Grateful Waves | ColorCue Thank You Card",
      "meta_description": "A modern, minimalist thank you card from ColorCue featuring a calm wave-inspired design.",
      "focus_keywords": [
        "thank you card",
        "modern thank you",
        "minimalist greeting card"
      ],
      "visual_direction": "Clean, modern desk or flat-lay with the Grateful Waves card centered, soft shadows, and subtle geometric props hinting at wave/grid motion.",
      "notes": "Keep the scene uncluttered; this hero should feel calm and confident, not busy."
    }
  ],
  "missing_products": []
}


Key things to notice:

sku values are exactly from product_catalog.csv.

hero_slot matches the column there (home-hero-1, etc.), or is inferred.

filename uses a consistent, deterministic pattern combining line, hero slot, SKU, and resolution.

meta_title / meta_description / focus_keywords are based on the real product_name + line, not made up names.

No new SKUs, no “mystery” products.

3️⃣ What the PDP & A+ Pack Output Should Look Like

For the E-Com PDP & A+ Content Pack, wired to the same catalog and WO-002 brief, you’d expect something like:

{
  "seo_title": "Birthday Remix – Neon Confetti | ColorCue Greeting Card",
  "seo_slug_hint": "birthday-remix-neon-confetti",
  "short_subtitle": "A neon-splashed birthday remix for the friend who loves to go big.",
  "feature_bullets": [
    {
      "label": "Bold neon confetti design",
      "body": "A high-energy layout that makes the front of the card feel like a mini party.",
      "pillar": "feature"
    },
    {
      "label": "Perfect for big personalities",
      "body": "Send it to the people who light up every room—they’ll appreciate the drama.",
      "pillar": "benefit"
    },
    {
      "label": "ColorCue quality you can feel",
      "body": "Thick cardstock and vibrant inks that stand out on any shelf or mantle.",
      "pillar": "emotion"
    }
  ],
  "long_description": "Birthday Remix – Neon Confetti is ColorCue’s loud love letter to the friend who never does anything halfway. Think neon confetti, bold shapes, and a design that lets them know you see their big energy and celebrate it. Printed on premium cardstock with a smooth matte finish, this card feels just as good as it looks.",
  "aplus_sections": [
    {
      "section_type": "hero",
      "heading": "Turn Their Birthday Into a Remix",
      "body": "Pair this card with a playlist, a party invite, or a surprise night out. It’s the perfect starting point for a celebration that feels like them.",
      "image_ideas": [
        "Lifestyle hero of the card on a party table with neon confetti and ColorCue branding subtly present."
      ]
    },
    {
      "section_type": "feature_grid",
      "heading": "Why You’ll Love Birthday Remix",
      "body": "Three quick reasons this card earns a permanent spot in your stash.",
      "image_ideas": [
        "Close-up of card texture",
        "Flat-lay with matching envelopes and other ColorCue birthday cards"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Does this card come with an envelope?",
      "answer": "Yes, each card includes a coordinating envelope."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there writing inside the card?",
      "answer": "This design is blank inside so you can write your own message."
    }
  ],
  "cross_sell_suggestions": [
    {
      "label": "Soft Surprise – Pastel Sprinkles",
      "rationale": "Recommend SKU-CC-BDAY-002 as a softer birthday option."
    },
    {
      "label": "Grateful Waves",
      "rationale": "Suggest SKU-CC-THANK-001 as a follow-up thank you card."
    }
  ]
}


In a fully multi-SKU setup, you might have an array of PDP entries keyed by sku, but the core principles stay the same:

All content maps to real SKUs from product_catalog.

seo_slug_hint lines up with url_slug.

Names reflect product_name and not some invented variant.

Cross-sell suggestions point to known SKUs (and ideally pass those SKUs through, not just labels).
