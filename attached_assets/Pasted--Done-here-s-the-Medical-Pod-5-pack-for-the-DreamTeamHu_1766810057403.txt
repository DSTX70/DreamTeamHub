✅ Done — here’s the **Medical Pod 5-pack** for the **DreamTeamHub repo / Replit**, designed to **preserve and carry forward** *all history, test results, imaging, symptom logs, and prior syntheses* **without inventing anything**.

Important: since I can’t automatically pull your prior medical records from other ChatGPT threads, this pack includes an **explicit ingestion protocol + templates** so nothing gets lost. Once you paste/import the records (or export summaries) into the folders defined here, DreamTeamHub can treat them as canonical history and retrieve them into Context Packs.

+
+# EVID-0034 — Medical Pod Operating System (Timeline → Evidence Map → Specialist Memos → Clinician Pack)
+
+## Problem
+Medical history becomes unusable when it’s scattered across chats, PDFs, labs, and notes. Without a structured system, patterns are missed and clinician time is wasted.
+
+## Constraints
+- Educational support only (not diagnosis/treatment)
+- Must preserve source fidelity (no “memory-only” summaries)
+- Must be clinician-friendly (fast to review, structured)
+- Must support ongoing updates without losing earlier context
+
+## Approach (Operating System)
+1) **Intake & source capture**
+   - Labs, imaging, visit notes, symptom logs, medication changes, timelines
+2) **Timeline**
+   - Chronological event stream with dates + source pointers
+3) **Evidence Map**
+   - Key findings grouped by system (ANS, neuro, cardio, endocrine, sleep, etc.)
+   - What supports vs what argues against hypotheses (educational framing)
+4) **Specialist memos**
+   - ANS hypothesis memo (Rowan) + tests-to-consider (educational)
+   - Sleep hypothesis memo (Somnus) + screening pathway (educational)
+   - Evidence synthesis summary (Avery)
+5) **Clinician Pack**
+   - 1-page executive brief
+   - Questions list
+   - Document checklist
+
+## Why it worked
+It makes a complex case reviewable: clinicians get chronology + signals + focused questions, and the system stays update-safe over time.
+
+## Outcome
+- Lower confusion, higher signal
+- Faster appointment prep
+- Reduced risk of losing key history across tools/threads
+
+## Where it landed
+Dream Team Hub Medical Pod governance + templates for durable record-keeping

+# EVID-0035 — Medical Record Ingestion Protocol (Zero-Loss History Carryover)
+
+## Problem
+History gets lost when “the system” relies on prior chat memory instead of a canonical repository of records and summaries.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must preserve original sources (lab PDFs, imaging reports, notes)
+- Must support partial additions over time
+- Must keep provenance: every summary points back to the source artifact
+
+## Approach (Ingestion Protocol)
+**Canonical storage layout**
+- `/canon/heritage/medical/records/` holds source references and extracted text summaries
+- `/canon/heritage/medical/timeline/` holds timeline entries
+- `/canon/heritage/medical/briefs/` holds clinician-ready outputs
+
+**Every ingested item must include**
+- date (YYYY-MM-DD)
+- type: lab | imaging | visit_note | symptom_log | medication_change | other
+- summary (short)
+- source pointer (file name, link, or “chat transcript reference”)
+
+**No-loss rule**
+- Do not overwrite older summaries; append a new entry and link it.
+- If a prior summary changes, create a new version and note why.
+
+## Why it worked
+It converts “chat history” into durable canon: searchable, versionable, and retrievable into future work without drift.
+
+## Outcome
+- Durable medical case history inside DreamTeamHub repo
+- Better traceability for clinicians
+
+## Where it landed
+DreamTeamHub Medical Pod record-keeping + future Context Packs

+
+# EVID-0036 — Test Result Synthesis Pattern (Normal/Abnormal, Trends, What It Rules In/Out)
+
+## Problem
+Raw lab/imaging data is hard to interpret and easy to misread without a repeatable synthesis method.
+
+## Constraints
+- Educational only; not diagnosis/treatment
+- Must avoid overclaiming causality
+- Must include “what this does NOT show” (to reduce anxiety and confusion)
+
+## Approach (Synthesis Pattern)
+For each test set:
+1) **What was tested** (panel/name + date)
+2) **Key findings**
+   - normal / borderline / abnormal (with reference range if available)
+3) **Trend** (if repeated over time)
+4) **Interpretation (educational)**
+   - plausible implications
+   - what it tends to rule out or make less likely
+   - what it suggests could be discussed with a clinician
+5) **Next questions**
+   - “If X, ask about Y”
+   - tests-to-consider (educational; clinician decides)
+6) **Provenance**
+   - link to source artifact + page/section if applicable
+
+## Why it worked
+It keeps analysis grounded and reduces misinterpretation by pairing findings with uncertainty, alternatives, and next-step questions.
+
+## Outcome
+- Clearer understanding of complex results
+- Better appointment questions
+- Reduced “chasing noise”
+
+## Where it landed

+# EVID-0037 — Specialist Memo Templates (ANS + Sleep) with Boundaries
+
+## Problem
+Specialist guidance becomes inconsistent without standard memo templates and boundary language. Medical content must be careful: educational, precise, and clinician-facing.
+
+## Constraints
+- Educational only; not diagnosis, treatment, prescriptions
+- Must include boundary statement in each memo
+- Must convert logs into structured hypotheses and tests-to-consider
+
+## Approach
+**ANS Memo (Rowan)**
+- symptoms pattern summary (orthostatic intolerance, anhidrosis, etc.)
+- hypotheses list (educational)
+- tests-to-consider (educational)
+- “questions to ask clinician”
+- boundary statement
+
+**Sleep Memo (Somnus)**
+- sleep-wake pattern summary
+- hypotheses list (educational)
+- screening pathways
+- clinician questions
+- boundary statement
+
+## Why it worked

+
+## Problem
+Appointments are short. Without a structured prep pack, key details get missed and clinicians can’t triage effectively.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be short (1-page brief)
+- Must be evidence-backed (not vibes)
+- Must include a prioritized question list
+
+## Approach (Prep Pack)
+1) **1-page Executive Brief**
+   - top symptoms + onset timeline
+   - major findings (labs/imaging)
+   - what has been ruled out (where appropriate)
+   - current meds/supplements
+2) **Clinician Question List**
+   - top 8–12 questions, ordered by impact
+3) **Document Checklist**
+   - what to bring / what to request (educational)
+
+## Why it worked
+It improves signal-to-noise and ensures the clinician sees the whole case quickly.
+
+## Outcome

+
+# Medical Case Canon (Zero-Loss)
+This folder is the durable, versionable home for medical history carried over from chats, labs, imaging, and notes.
+
+## Folder structure
+- `records/`  Source summaries and pointers (labs, imaging, notes)
+- `timeline/` Timeline entries (chronological)
+- `briefs/`   Clinician-ready outputs (exec brief, memos, question lists)
+
+## How to ingest history from prior threads
+1) For each lab/imaging/note/log, create a file in `records/` using the template.
+2) Add a timeline entry in `timeline/`.
+3) When enough records exist, generate/update:
+   - `briefs/ExecutiveBrief.md`
+   - `briefs/Questions.md`
+   - `briefs/ANS_Memo_Rowen.md`
+   - `briefs/Sleep_Memo_Somnus.md`
+
+## Safety boundary
+This system is educational support only. It organizes evidence and questions for licensed clinicians.

## ✅ What “carry over all history/test results” looks like now

This pack gives you a **safe, durable home** in DreamTeamHub for everything you’ve already captured in other chats:

* Labs → `canon/heritage/medical/records/`
* Imaging reports → `canon/heritage/medical/records/`
* Symptom logs → `canon/heritage/medical/records/`
* Timeline events → `canon/heritage/medical/timeline/`
* Clinician-ready syntheses → `canon/heritage/medical/briefs/`

### The only missing step (you control it)

Copy/paste or export your existing medical thread summaries/test results into these templates (no rewriting required—just structured storage with source pointers).

---

## Post-apply verification

Run:

```bash
npm run heritage:scoreboard
```

Then update `canon/heritage/STATUS.md` totals (you should now be at least **EVID-0038** and decisions through **036** if everything so far is applied).

Next in the list after Medical Pod: **Religious Scholar Council + Writer Pool 5-pack** (governed publishing gates).
