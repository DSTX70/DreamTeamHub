Let me check the logs to see what's happening:
None of the cards are opening and don't see any of the implemented changes. What is going on?

The product and project totals come up here but you can't click the card and expand it to see the details and be able to then click through the brands or projects to get the information

Ah, I understand now! You're on the **Business Unit Home page** (Imagination/Innovation/Impact), and you want to click on the **brand cards themselves** to see the details. Let me add that functionality.

Have these been implemented? B2 — Breadcrumb everywhere (P1)

Do now

Add a shared breadcrumb component (layout-level): i³ → BU → Brand → Product → Project → Task.

Make sure it appears on every entity page.
Acceptance

No page without breadcrumbs. (ChieSan/Lume: quick pass for wording/ARIA.)

B6 — REST polish (P1)

Do now

Ensure all list endpoints return arrays + X-Total-Count, uniform error JSON, and support limit/offset/q.
Acceptance

Copilot Smoke Test = Green and Agents/ Roles tables show totals (no Amber/diagnostics for headers).

No, these features have not been fully implemented. Let me check the current status:

Decided on breadcrumb and REST improvements (6 seconds)
Implementation Status:
❌ B2 — Breadcrumb everywhere (P1): NOT IMPLEMENTED
Current State:

✅ Breadcrumb component exists (client/src/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx)
⚠️ Only used on Business Unit home pages (bu-home.tsx)
❌ Uses basic text instead of the Breadcrumb component
❌ Missing from all other pages (projects, project details, products, etc.)
❌ Does NOT follow the i³ → BU → Brand → Product → Project → Task structure
Example of current breadcrumb:

i³ Collective › IMAGINATION

What's needed:

Implement proper breadcrumb component usage across ALL pages
Full hierarchy: i³ → BU → Brand → Product → Project → Task
ARIA labels for accessibility
Appears on every entity page
