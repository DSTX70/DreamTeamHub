+# EVID-0014 — LIAC Council Workflow + Activation Triggers
+
+## Problem
+Inclusion/accessibility/representation quality drifts when review is informal or optional. Teams miss harms, tone mismatches, or accessibility gaps—especially under speed.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be lightweight enough to run frequently
+- Must be explicit about when LIAC is required vs optional
+- Must produce clear, actionable feedback (not vague “feels off” notes)
+- Must preserve brand voice while preventing harm and drift
+
+## Approach (LIAC Workflow)
+**1) Trigger / Intake**
+- LIAC is activated when content is:
+  - public-facing and identity-adjacent, or
+  - includes representation/identity cues, or
+  - targets a broad or sensitive audience, or
+  - becomes a reusable template/playbook, or
+  - has any risk flags from team review
+
+**2) Scope definition (fast)**
+- Identify: audience, channel, intent, constraints, and “must not do” items.
+
+**3) Review pass**
+- Check for: stereotyping, exclusion, biased framing, accessibility gaps, tone drift, and “unintended implications.”
+
+**4) Output**
+- Provide: specific edits, a short rationale, and severity tagging:
+  - **Blocker** (must fix before publish)
+  - **Recommended** (improves quality)
+  - **Optional** (nice-to-have)
+
+**5) Sign-off + logging**
+- Approved outputs receive a recorded sign-off.
+- Blocking items are tracked until cleared.
+
+## Why it worked
+It made inclusivity/accessibility a **repeatable gate** with predictable triggers and concrete outputs—without slowing every task.
+
+## Outcome
+- Fewer public-facing tone/representation missteps
+- More consistent “voice with care”
+- Faster revision cycles (feedback is specific)
+
+## Where it landed
+Dream Team Hub governance for inclusive publishing and brand-safe comms

+# EVID-0015 — LIAC Approval Gates + Sign-off Capture Pattern
+
+## Problem
+Teams “intend” to do inclusivity review but it gets skipped under pressure. Without a formal gate, the system can’t prove review happened.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be auditable (who approved what and when)
+- Must be simple (no bureaucracy explosion)
+- Must clearly block publishing when required
+
+## Approach
+**Approval gate pattern**
+- Any content flagged as **LIAC-required** cannot be marked “Publish-Ready” until sign-off is captured.
+
+**Sign-off capture**
+- Record:
+  - reviewer identity (LIAC reviewer or council seat)
+  - timestamp (signed_at)
+  - scope of approval (what artifact/version)
+  - notes (if any) and unresolved follow-ups (should be none for final sign-off)
+
+**Blocking semantics**
+- If LIAC issues a **Blocker**, the artifact remains “Not Publish-Ready” until the blocker is resolved and sign-off is reissued.
+
+## Why it worked
+It converted “review intent” into a **hard gate**. This protects the brand and creates durable governance.
+
+## Outcome
+- Fewer skipped reviews
+- Clear accountability
+- Easier audits and retrospectives
+
+## Where it landed

+
+# EVID-0016 — Bias/Balance Rubric + “No-Paraphrase” List Discipline
+
+## Problem
+Even well-meaning content can encode bias (framing, assumptions, stereotypes). Without a rubric, review becomes subjective and inconsistent. Without a “no-paraphrase” list, sensitive canonical language can drift.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be usable quickly (rubric, not essays)
+- Must apply across brands and tones
+- Must preserve canonical language where required
+
+## Approach
+**Bias/Balance rubric (fast checks)**
+1) **Assumptions:** Does the content assume a default identity or experience?
+2) **Representation:** Are groups depicted with agency and dignity?
+3) **Stereotypes:** Any tropey shorthand, coded language, or caricature risk?
+4) **Power framing:** Does it blame/shame or flatten lived experience?
+5) **Accessibility:** Readability, clarity, and inclusive phrasing.
+6) **Audience fit:** Tone matches brand without punching down.
+
+**No-Paraphrase list**
+- Maintain a list of “must not rewrite” canonical lines (e.g., approved taglines, legal/scholar-vetted phrasing, safety disclaimers).
+- If a line is on the list:
+  - it can be quoted as-is, or
+  - replaced only via an approved change-control process.
+
+## Why it worked
+The rubric makes review repeatable and reduces drift. The no-paraphrase list protects high-stakes canonical language from accidental mutation.
+
+## Outcome
+- More consistent inclusivity outcomes
+- Less subjective debate
+- Stronger governance for canonical copy
+
+## Where it landed
+LIAC review process + governed publishing flows

+
+# EVID-0017 — Cultural Nuance + Safety Review Pattern (Escalation Model)
+
+## Problem
+Some outputs require specialized nuance review (culture, religion, sensitive identity contexts). A single “general review” pass can miss context-specific harms.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must avoid overblocking routine work
+- Must escalate only when needed
+- Must produce clear sign-off ownership
+
+## Approach
+**Escalation model**
+- LIAC is the default lens for inclusivity/accessibility.
+- Escalate to specialist review when content includes:
+  - culturally specific references that could be misused or misrepresented
+  - religious/philosophical claims that require scholar governance
+  - vulnerable audiences or high-stakes tone requirements
+
+**How escalation works**
+1) LIAC flags “Specialist Review Required”
+2) Specialist reviews the flagged portions and returns:
+   - approved edits + rationale
+   - required disclaimers/constraints
+3) LIAC issues final approval after specialist feedback is integrated
+
+## Why it worked
+It keeps the system fast for most work, while ensuring deep review exists for content that truly needs it.
+
+## Outcome
+- Better cultural accuracy and tone safety
+- Clear sign-off responsibility
+- Lower risk of sensitive missteps
+
+## Where it landed

+# EVID-0018 — Publication Readiness Checklist + DoD Gate (LIAC)
+
+## Problem
+Teams ship content that is “done” in intent but not in quality: unclear CTAs, accessibility gaps, tone drift, missing constraints, or unresolved review items.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be easy to apply across brands
+- Must prevent shipping with open blockers
+- Must preserve brand voice while meeting inclusivity/accessibility needs
+
+## Approach (DoD Gate)
+Before an artifact can be marked Publish-Ready:
+1) **No LIAC Blockers remain**
+2) **Audience + channel are explicit**
+3) **Tone is aligned to brand voice** (no generic drift)
+4) **Accessibility checks** (readability, clarity, formatting)
+5) **Canonical copy protected** (no-paraphrase items preserved)
+6) **Sign-off captured when required**
+
+## Why it worked
+It standardizes “ready” across teams and prevents accidental shipping of half-reviewed work.
+
+## Outcome
+- Cleaner releases
+- Lower rework after publish
+- Stronger trust in “Publish-Ready” status

1. Confirm files exist:

* `canon/heritage/evidence/EVID-0014.md` … `EVID-0018.md`
* `canon/heritage/decisions/DTH-20251226-012.md` … `DTH-20251226-016.md`
* `canon/heritage/evidence/_EVIDENCE_INDEX.json`
* `canon/heritage/decisions/_DECISION_INDEX.json`

2. (Optional) If you want the old central `decision-log.md` to reflect these too, you can append a short “See also decisions/ index” note — but this drop intentionally avoids overwriting anything you already have.
