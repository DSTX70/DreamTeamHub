# Dream Team Hub – Pack Usage Guide (v2)

This guide defines **when** each Pack should auto-run, **how** owners should use it manually, and **what “Definition of Done” (DoD)** looks like.

Use this as the **source of truth** for:

- Work Item → Pack auto-run rules  
- Pack expectations and handoffs (Pods, Drive exports, follow-up WIs)  
- “Is this Pack complete enough to share outside?” checks
