+# EVID-0029 — GTM System (Positioning → Channels → Offer → Measurement Loop)
+
+## Problem
+Marketing execution fails when “posting” and “ads” happen without positioning clarity, offer discipline, or a measurement loop.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be usable for both early-stage brands and multi-line portfolios
+- Must keep claims verifiable (no hype without proof)
+- Must map channels to explicit targets and outcomes
+
+## Approach (GTM System)
+1) **Positioning**
+   - Who it’s for, what problem it solves, why it’s different
+2) **Offer**
+   - The CTA and conversion event (what action matters)
+3) **Channel plan**
+   - Select primary channels (1–3) with audience rationale
+4) **Creative system**
+   - Repeatable content pillars + hooks; not one-off posts
+5) **Measurement loop**
+   - Define KPIs + cadence (weekly review) + next experiment
+
+## Why it worked
+It made marketing a system, not a vibe—every action ties to a target and a measurable outcome.
+
+## Outcome
+- Clearer execution priorities
+- Faster iteration and learning
+- Less wasted spend/content
+
+## Where it landed
+Marketing & Social Pod operating model (Prism-led strategy + Echo-led execution)

+# EVID-0030 — Content Calendar System (Pillars + Formats + Cadence + Reuse)
+
+## Problem
+Teams burn out when content is created from scratch daily. Without pillars and reuse, consistency drops and quality degrades.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be platform-native but reusable across channels
+- Must scale across multiple brands/collections without voice drift
+- Must be shippable (calendar you can actually follow)
+
+## Approach
+**Content pillars**
+- 3–6 pillars that map to brand + offer (e.g., behind-the-scenes, product, story, proof, community)
+
+**Format library**
+- Reels/shorts, carousels, static, stories, lives, email snippets
+
+**Cadence**
+- Weekly schedule that is realistic
+
+**Reuse rules**
+- One “hero” piece → split into 3–7 derivatives
+- Keep a backlog of evergreen posts
+
+## Why it worked
+It created sustainable consistency and lowered creative load while improving quality.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher posting consistency
+- Faster production cycles
+- Better alignment with brand voice and offers
+
+## Where it landed
+Echo-owned content operations with Prism guidance on pillars and goals

+# EVID-0031 — Influencer/Creator Workflow (Fit → Outreach → Brief → Tracking → Reuse)
+
+## Problem
+Influencer efforts fail when creators are chosen randomly, briefs are vague, and outcomes aren’t tracked.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must protect brand voice and safety
+- Must be measurable (not just “likes”)
+- Must be repeatable and scalable
+
+## Approach
+1) **Fit selection**
+   - Audience match, tone match, content quality, platform relevance
+2) **Outreach**
+   - Personalized pitch + clear value exchange
+3) **Brief**
+   - Brand guardrails, key message, CTA, do/don’t list, deadlines
+4) **Tracking**
+   - Links/codes, post URLs, deliverables, outcome metrics
+5) **Reuse**
+   - Convert creator content into owned assets (with permissions)
+
+## Why it worked
+It turned creators into a reliable channel rather than a gamble.
+
+## Outcome
+- Better creator fit and fewer off-brand posts
+- Cleaner ROI measurement
+- More reusable assets
+
+## Where it landed
+Marketing & Social Pod creator system (Echo + Prism)

+# EVID-0032 — Paid Prospecting Discipline (Budget Caps + Targets + Creative Testing)
+
+## Problem
+Paid ads waste money when budgets are unrealistic, targeting is unclear, and creative isn’t tested systematically.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must fit startup budgets and scale safely
+- Must define daily/monthly caps by channel
+- Must define measurement and iteration cadence
+
+## Approach
+**Budget discipline**
+- Define monthly cap → allocate by channel → enforce daily caps
+
+**Targeting discipline**
+- Clear audiences, exclusions, and hypothesis per campaign
+
+**Creative testing**
+- Test hooks and creatives in controlled batches
+- Promote winners; pause losers
+
+**Measurement**
+- CPA/CAC, CTR, conversion rate, ROAS (as applicable), with weekly decisions
+
+## Why it worked
+It prevented “set and forget” spend and forced learning and iteration under clear constraints.
+
+## Outcome
+- More efficient spend
+- Faster learning cycles
+- Clear decisions on what to scale
+
+## Where it landed
+Prism-led paid discipline within Marketing & Social Pod

+# EVID-0033 — Compliance & Claims Guardrails (Kid-safe, No Unverifiable Claims)
+
+## Problem
+Brand trust is lost when marketing makes unverifiable claims, uses unsafe content patterns, or ignores kid-safe constraints where relevant.
+
+## Constraints
+- Claims must be substantiated or framed as opinion/aspiration
+- Kid-safe compliance awareness where applicable (children’s content/communities)
+- Avoid platform policy violations and sensitive targeting misuse
+
+## Approach
+**Claims discipline**
+- If it can’t be proven, don’t state it as fact
+- Use evidence packs/metrics where available
+
+**Kid-safe guardrails**
+- Avoid collecting personal info from children
+- Use appropriate language and imagery for child-focused audiences
+- Keep community engagement safe and moderated
+
+**Review gate**
+- High-stakes posts/campaigns get an explicit review pass (LIAC/Sentinel as needed)
+
+## Why it worked
+It made growth sustainable: credibility stays intact and platform risk is reduced.
+
+## Outcome
+- Fewer retractions and corrections
+- Lower risk of policy issues
+- Stronger long-term trust
+
+## Where it landed
+Marketing & Social Pod governance with LIAC/Security escalation where needed

## Post-apply verification

Run:

```bash
npm run heritage:scoreboard
```

Then update `canon/heritage/STATUS.md` totals (it should now reflect **EVID up through 0033** and decisions up through **031**, if everything has been applied).

Next in the list: **Medical Pod 5-pack** (unless you want **Scholar Council** next).
