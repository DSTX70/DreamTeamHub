Not yet **as a confirmed, implemented feature** — we’ve **designed it and I provided the patch drop**, but you haven’t told me you applied it / verified it running the way you did for **Convert to Work Item** and the provenance badge.

So status is:

* ✅ **Strategy → Lock → Convert → Work Item** = implemented + tested (you confirmed)
* ⚠️ **Work Item stages (RECOMMENDATION → APPROVED → DROP_READY)** = **not confirmed implemented** yet

---

## What “added” would look like (how to verify in 60 seconds)

If the stages patch is applied, these should exist in **DreamTeamHub**:

### 1) API routes respond

* `GET /api/work-items/:id/stage`
* `POST /api/work-items/:id/stage/recommendation`
* `POST /api/work-items/:id/stage/approve`
* `POST /api/work-items/:id/stage/drop`

Quick check: open a Work Item, hit the stage endpoint in browser/devtools:

* `/api/work-items/33/stage` (use a real id)

### 2) New data folder appears

* `data/work-item-stages/<workItemId>.json`

### 3) UI shows the pipeline controls on Work Item detail

On `client/src/pages/work-item-detail.tsx` you should see:

* “Execution Pipeline” card
* Buttons:

  * Generate Recommendation
  * Approve Recommendation
  * Generate GigsterGarage Drop
* Stage badge changes as you click through

---

## If you want, I can give you the exact drop again (clean + aligned to your current Work Item fields)

Because you mentioned your Convert payload includes:

* `owner` (good)
* `inputs` (full strategy markdown)
* `output` (“Execute the locked strategy…”)
* `playbook` (provenance text + source id + locked timestamp)

That’s great — and it means the stage generator should use `workItem.inputs` and maybe show `workItem.owner` in the recommendation.

### Tell me just one thing:

Are you storing Work Item “inputs” as **`inputs`** or **`input`** on the Work Item record returned by `/api/work-items/:id`?

If it’s `inputs` (most likely), I’ll produce a final patch drop that:

* uses your field names exactly
* uses your existing provenance parsing to pass `strategySessionId`
* adds a clean “Stage” badge to `/work` (optional)

But if you already applied the earlier stage patch, just reply: **“Yes, applied”** and paste any error you hit (if any), and I’ll adjust quickly.
