+# EVID-0062 — GigsterGarage Pilot Pod (Curated Cast + Approval-First Delivery)
+
+## Problem
+Pilots fail when execution lacks: clear ownership, safe rollout discipline, evidence traceability, and business/ops realism. “Fast shipping” without gates creates regressions and loss of trust.
+
+## Constraints
+- Approval-first execution (Dustin is sole approver)
+- Non-executing outputs by default (paste-ready drops only)
+- No schema changes unless explicitly approved
+- Evidence-grade receipts and traceability
+- Target isolation: GigsterGarage pilot repo
+
+## Pod Definition (Locked)
+**Pod Key:** `gigster_garage_pilot`  
+**Purpose:** Run the DTH pipeline for GigsterGarage: Strategy → Lock → Work Item → Recommendation → Approval → Drop (manual apply), with QA/security/evidence gates and SMB viability checks.
+
+### Recommended Cast (Assigned)
+**Core delivery engine**
+- OS — orchestration + gate enforcement
+- Lume — UX clarity and workflow simplification
+- Forge — architecture/backend correctness
+- LexiCode — paste-ready patches + repo realism
+- CodeBlock — modular/flag gating (adapter-first)
+- Verifier — QA + CI gates + regression checks
+- Pulse — perf guardrails (avoid regressions)
+- Sentinel — security review and risk flags
+- Aegis — governance/control points
+- Archivist — evidence/traceability packs
+- Conductor — pilot cadence + KPI framing
+- Scout — research/validation support
+
+**Business / SMB SMEs (required for viability)**
+- Ledger — pricing/unit economics + billing implications + ROI sanity checks
+- Navi — ops/process and rollout sequencing (how it runs in real life)
+- Amani — SMB operator lens + partnerships/market-fit constraints
+- ChieSan — experience/trust + customer-facing language nuance
+
+### Activation Rules
+- Repo hint includes `GigsterGarage`
+- Target repo is `GigsterGarage`
+- Any pilot patch cycle using approval-first execution pipeline
+
+### Guardrails
+- No auto-apply
+- No VSuiteHQ push until explicitly enabled
+- FILE/END_FILE discipline required for drops
+- No schema changes unless explicitly approved
+- Evidence packs required for “done”
+
+## Why it worked
+It keeps pilots fast but safe: the execution engine ships, the SMEs prevent non-viable choices, and governance/evidence preserves trust.
+
+## Outcome
+- Repeatable pilot delivery without silent execution
+- Clear accountability per role
+- Better “real world” viability (SMB + ops) before scaling
+
+## Where it landed
+DreamTeamHub cast presets + Heritage pod definition for GigsterGarage pilot workflows
+
+## Related Skills
+- strategy_to_execution_pipeline
+- patch_drop_discipline
+- pilot_factory_ops
+
+## Related Decisions
+- DTH-20251227-060

+# EVID-0063 — Tenant & Billing Pod (Revenue Systems) (Security + Financial Boundary)
+
+## Problem
+Tenant isolation and billing are hard boundaries: mistakes can cause access leaks, incorrect charges, disputes, and security incidents. These concerns are specialized enough to require a dedicated pod.
+
+## Constraints
+- Approval-first execution (no silent billing changes)
+- Staging-first verification before any production billing
+- Webhook signature verification + idempotency required
+- Audit logs for billing state transitions
+- Privacy posture and retention considerations (as applicable)
+
+## Pod Definition (Locked)
+**Pod Key:** `tenant_billing_revenue_systems`  
+**Purpose:** Own multi-tenant isolation, entitlements, and billing/subscription lifecycle safely (Stripe/webhooks/idempotency), with explicit approval and evidence-grade artifacts.
+
+### Recommended Cast (Assigned)
+- OS — orchestration + approval gates
+- Forge — architecture and tenant data model
+- LexiCode — implementation + patch drops
+- Bridge — SDK/connector contracts (policy headers + audit)
+- Verifier — QA (webhook/idempotency + regression gates)
+- Pulse — perf/cost guardrails
+- Sentinel — security boundary review
+- Praetor — privacy posture/retention guidance (as needed)
+- Aegis — governance/control points
+- Archivist — evidence/traceability packs
+- Ledger — pricing/unit economics sanity
+- Navi — ops rollout sequencing (staging → prod discipline)
+
+### Activation Rules
+- Work includes: tenant, multi-tenant, entitlement, subscription, billing, Stripe, invoices, proration, trials, metering
+- Any work touching payment flows or plan-based access gating
+
+### Guardrails
+- No production billing without explicit approval + staging verification
+- Webhook signature verification required
+- Idempotency required on billing mutations
+- Audit logs required for billing state transitions
+- No auto-apply by default
+
+## Why it worked
+It treats billing and tenancy as a boundary layer with gates, tests, and evidence — rather than “just another feature.”
+
+## Outcome
+- Lower risk of financial/security incidents
+- Clear ownership and review paths
+- Higher confidence in revenue-system changes
+
+## Where it landed
+DreamTeamHub heritage pod definition + cast preset for tenant/billing work
+
+## Related Skills

+# Decision: DTH-20251227-060 — Lock GigsterGarage Pilot Pod (Curated Cast)
+**Date:** 2025-12-27  
+**Status:** Locked  
+
+## Decision
+Establish `gigster_garage_pilot` as the official GigsterGarage pilot pod and curated cast. This pod is responsible for approval-first delivery using the DTH pipeline and includes business/SMB SMEs (Ledger, Navi, Amani, ChieSan) as required participants for viability.
+
+## Rationale
+Ensures pilots ship safely and credibly with gates, evidence, and real-world business/ops constraints.

+**Status:** Locked  
+
+## Decision
+Establish `tenant_billing_revenue_systems` as the official pod for multi-tenant isolation, entitlements, and billing/subscription lifecycle work. This pod enforces staging-first verification, webhook signature verification, idempotency, audit logs, and approval-first governance.
+
+## Rationale
+Tenant + billing are security and financial boundaries; dedicated ownership and gates reduce risk and prevent costly incidents.

## After applying

Run the scoreboard refresh (since you’re tracking totals tightly):

```bash
npm run heritage:status
npm run heritage:index:sync
```

If you want, next we can also add **two Cast Preset “badges”** on Strategy sessions and Work Items (e.g., “GigsterGarage Pod” / “Tenant & Billing Pod”) based on repo_hint or keywords so the UI reflects the pod selection visibly.
