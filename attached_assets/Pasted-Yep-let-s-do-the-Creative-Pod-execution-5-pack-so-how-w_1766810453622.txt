Yep — let’s do the **Creative Pod execution 5-pack** so “how we produce visuals + copy” is preserved as evidence-grade canon (not just brand locks).

This applies to **DreamTeamHub repo / Replit** and adds:

* **Evidence Packs:** `EVID-0049 → EVID-0053`
* **Decisions:** `DTH-20251226-047 → 051`
* Index updates: `_EVIDENCE_INDEX.json` + `_DECISION_INDEX.json`
* Skills updates: creative execution skills added to `skills.json`

+# EVID-0049 — Visual Asset Pipeline OS (Brief → Build → QA → Export → Manifest)
+
+## Problem
+Visual output quality drifts when assets are produced ad hoc: wrong sizes, inconsistent brand usage, missing source references, and unclear “final” states.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must enforce brand locks and canonical assets
+- Must produce spec-compliant exports (web, social, print/KDP, merch)
+- Must be audit-friendly and repeatable
+- Must not invent missing assets; blockers must be listed
+
+## Approach (Pipeline)
+1) **Brief**
+   - target brand/collection, purpose (hero/mockup/cover), required specs, usage context
+2) **Build**
+   - Nova/Walt produces on-model, brand-locked design
+3) **QA**
+   - check brand lock (palette/fonts/logo), layout rules, readability, safe areas
+4) **Export**
+   - export exact sizes/formats per spec (no guesswork)
+5) **Manifest**
+   - produce canonical filenames + mini manifest for batches
+
+## Why it worked
+It turns “design” into a predictable production system: fewer mistakes, fewer revisions, consistent brand execution.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher asset consistency and quality
+- Faster production cycles
+- Reduced rework due to spec errors
+
+## Where it landed
+Creative & Design Pod operational delivery discipline (Nova-led execution)

+
+# EVID-0050 — Template Governance (2-up, Square/Portrait/Landscape, Hero Crops) + “No Near-Match Templates”
+
+## Problem
+Templates multiply and drift: “almost the same” layouts cause inconsistency and confuse production, especially across collections (Fab Card Co lines, OUAS, etc.).
+
+## Constraints
+- Must use approved templates where locked
+- Must not create “near match” templates without approval
+- Must support multiple formats (square, 5x7 portrait, 7x5 landscape, web hero)
+
+## Approach
+**Template governance rules**
+- Use canonical templates (e.g., official 2-up mockup templates) when provided
+- If a new template is needed:
+  - treat it as a controlled addition (versioned + change-logged)
+  - document intended use + constraints
+- Never fork templates silently
+
+**Format discipline examples (from canon rules)**
+- Remix Collection: square format direction (album-cover feel) and canonical 2-up layout
+- Out Loud: rotate among square/portrait/landscape formats per rule
+- Web hero: define exact dimensions and safe areas for headlines/CTA overlays
+
+## Why it worked
+It prevented template sprawl and guaranteed that production assets look cohesive across time.
+
+## Outcome
+- Cleaner brand consistency
+- Faster design execution (less “which template?” debate)
+- Fewer layout regressions
+
+## Where it landed
+Creative production governance across brand/collection pipelines

+
+# EVID-0051 — Export Specs Discipline (Web + Social + Print/KDP) + Safe Area Guides
+
+## Problem
+Great designs fail in the real world when export specs are wrong: crops cut off text, print bleeds are incorrect, and sizes don’t match platform requirements.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must export using exact specs, not approximations
+- Must include safe-area guidance when needed (especially hero/social)
+- Must preserve brand lock
+
+## Approach
+**Export spec discipline**
+- Every asset ships with:
+  - exact pixel dimensions and orientation
+  - file format and naming
+  - safe-area guidance (if overlay text may exist)
+
+**Known canonical requirement examples**
+- Book assets: 6" x 9" with bleed — 1875 x 2775 px @ 300 DPI (KDP spec)
+- Web hero assets: exported to exact requested size with optional “headline space preserved” variant when needed
+- Social variants: platform-friendly crops when required (e.g., 1080×1350, 1080×1920)
+
+## Why it worked
+It reduced avoidable rework and ensured assets look correct wherever they’re used.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher publishing success rate
+- Fewer “please resize” loops
+- More reliable templates and campaigns
+
+## Where it landed
+Creative export QA system (Nova-led) with spec-first delivery

+# EVID-0052 — Tone/Voice Enforcement for Creative Deliverables (Sparkster + Storybloom)
+
+## Problem
+Copy and creative direction drift when tone/voice is treated as optional. “Almost right” voice produces brand inconsistency across products and channels.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must respect brand lock voice attributes per brand/collection
+- Must avoid generic, default corporate tone
+- Must keep claims verifiable and safe
+
+## Approach
+**Voice enforcement rules**
+- Every public-facing deliverable must align to:
+  - brand voice attributes
+  - “do/don’t” rules
+  - canonical taglines/no-paraphrase items (where applicable)
+
+**Roles**
+- Sparkster: primary voice authority and tone gate
+- Storybloom: narrative cohesion and PR framing (audience-fit)
+
+**Execution discipline**
+- Provide 2–3 options only when useful, always with rationale
+- Prefer clarity over cleverness when stakes are high
+
+## Why it worked
+It prevents the “who wrote this?” effect. Voice stays consistent across time and across hands.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher brand consistency and trust
+- Better conversion and audience resonance
+- Faster approvals because rules are explicit
+
+## Where it landed
+Creative & Design Pod copy governance across brands and launches

+# EVID-0053 — Creative Review Gates (Brand Lock + LIAC + Safety Escalation)
+
+## Problem
+Creative mistakes become public mistakes when review gates are unclear: off-brand variants, accidental harm, or unsafe framing slips through.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must keep review lightweight but real
+- Must clearly define when LIAC or Security escalation is required
+- Must capture approvals for high-stakes outputs
+
+## Approach (Review Gates)
+**Gate 1 — Brand Lock QA (always for public-facing)**
+- Verify palette/fonts/logos/templates match canon
+- Block “near match” variants
+
+**Gate 2 — Tone/Voice QA (public-facing copy)**
+- Sparkster voice gate (and Storybloom for narrative context)
+
+**Gate 3 — LIAC review (triggered)**
+- Activate when representation, identity, accessibility, or sensitive audiences are in play
+- Use blocker/recommended/optional outputs and sign-off rules
+
+**Gate 4 — Security/Privacy escalation (as needed)**
+- When claims touch security/compliance or sensitive system behavior
+
+## Why it worked
+It prevented high-cost public errors while keeping the creative engine fast and consistent.
+
+## Outcome
+- Less rework after publishing
+- Higher trust in “ready”
+- Safer, more inclusive creative outputs
+
+## Where it landed
+Portfolio creative QA and publishing readiness discipline

## Post-apply verification

Run:

```bash
npm run heritage:scoreboard
```

Then update `canon/heritage/STATUS.md` totals (now that we’re up through **EVID-0053** and decisions through **051**).

If you want, I can also update `STATUS.md` totals for you once you paste the latest `npm run heritage:scoreboard` output (just the counts/ranges).
