+# EVID-0039 — Religious Scholar Council + Writer Pool Operating System (Governed Publishing)
+
+## Problem
+Religious/philosophical content can be high-impact and easy to misrepresent. Without a governed workflow, outputs can drift, reflect bias, or accidentally rewrite sensitive canonical language.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must not publish without scholar approval where required
+- Must preserve nuance and avoid oversimplification
+- Must keep an auditable trail (who approved what, when)
+- Must maintain balance across traditions when the scope requires it
+
+## Approach (Operating System)
+**Roles**
+- Religious Scholar Council (seats per tradition)
+- Philosophical/Religious Writer Pool (2+)
+- Advisory Council Liaison (coordination + NDAs + scheduling)
+- Editorial Approvals Lead (gates publication on scholar_signed_at)
+- Scholar Ops Coordinator (queue, SLAs, tracking)
+
+**Workflow**
+1) **Intake**
+   - define audience, intent, tradition scope (single tradition vs comparative), and risk level
+2) **Scholar input**
+   - relevant scholar seat(s) provide notes, constraints, and “do not paraphrase” flags
+3) **Writer draft**
+   - writers produce warm modern renderings strictly within scholar constraints
+4) **Scholar review**
+   - scholars approve or return edits (explicitly noting blockers)
+5) **Editorial gate**
+   - Editorial Approvals Lead confirms scholar_signed_at and closes blockers
+6) **Publish readiness**
+   - context cards, citations/attribution, and “no-paraphrase” compliance verified
+
+## Why it worked
+It separates “writing skill” from “authority and nuance”: writers craft accessible language, scholars ensure accuracy and balance, and publication is gated by recorded approval.
+
+## Outcome
+- Reduced misrepresentation risk
+- Higher quality, more trustworthy outputs
+- Auditable governance trail
+
+## Where it landed
+Governed publishing system for religious/philosophical content across the portfolio

+# EVID-0040 — Scholar Signed Gate (scholar_signed_at) + Editorial Approval Enforcement
+
+## Problem
+Even strong drafts are unsafe to publish if scholar review was skipped. Without a hard gate, “we meant to review” becomes “we forgot.”
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be auditable and deterministic
+- Must block publishing when required
+- Must capture scope of approval (artifact + version)
+
+## Approach
+**Gate definition**
+- Any governed religious/philosophical output is **Not Publish-Ready** until:
+  - scholar review is completed, and
+  - scholar_signed_at is recorded, and
+  - no blockers remain
+
+**Approval record includes**
+- scholar seat(s) approving
+- artifact/version reference
+- signed_at timestamp
+- notes (optional), blockers (must be empty for final sign-off)
+
+**Editorial Approvals Lead responsibilities**
+- verify scholar_signed_at exists
+- confirm “no-paraphrase” compliance
+- confirm context-card standards are met
+- approve final publication state
+
+## Why it worked
+It replaces informal review with enforceable governance and preserves accountability.
+
+## Outcome
+- Fewer skipped reviews
+- Stronger trust posture
+- Clear audit trail for sensitive content
+
+## Where it landed
+Governed publishing gates for Scholar Council outputs

+# EVID-0041 — Quarterly Audit Rubric + Change Log Discipline (Scholar Governance)
+
+## Problem
+Even good systems drift over time. Without audits and change logs, standards degrade, bias re-enters, and canonical constraints get lost.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be lightweight but real (repeatable quarterly)
+- Must track changes to rubrics, no-paraphrase lists, and standards
+- Must include bias/balance checks
+
+## Approach
+**Quarterly audit**
+- sample a set of published artifacts
+- verify scholar_signed_at is present where required
+- verify no-paraphrase compliance
+- verify context cards exist and match standards
+- verify balance/bias rubric adherence (where comparative scope applies)
+
+**Change log discipline**
+- Any update to the governance system:
+  - increments version/date
+  - logs what changed and why
+  - references the approving scholar seat(s) (if applicable)
+
+## Why it worked
+It makes governance durable: standards remain stable, and updates are explicit and reviewable.
+
+## Outcome
+- Reduced long-term drift
+- Higher confidence in published content quality
+- Repeatable governance evolution
+
+## Where it landed
+Scholar governance maintenance and accountability

+# EVID-0042 — Context-Card Standards + No-Paraphrase List Operations
+
+## Problem
+Sensitive phrases and canonical statements drift when paraphrased. Readers also misunderstand content when context (tradition, interpretation, scope) is missing.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must preserve protected canonical language exactly
+- Must provide context so readers understand scope and interpretation boundaries
+- Must be simple enough to attach consistently
+
+## Approach
+**No-paraphrase list**
+- Maintain a list of protected phrases (approved taglines, scholar-vetted lines, safety disclaimers).
+- Rules:
+  - If it’s on the list, it must be used verbatim (or replaced only via change control).
+  - Writers may not “improve” protected lines.
+
+**Context-card standards**
+Each governed artifact includes a context card:
+- tradition scope (single tradition vs comparative)
+- source posture (scholar notes vs interpretation vs commentary)
+- audience level (intro, intermediate, advanced)
+- “what this is / what this isn’t”
+- required disclaimers (where applicable)
+
+## Why it worked
+It prevents accidental doctrinal drift and gives readers the interpretive frame needed to avoid misunderstandings.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher consistency and safety
+- Clearer reader expectations
+- Reduced “tone drift” and semantic mutation over time
+
+## Where it landed
+Scholar-governed publishing standards and templates

+
+# EVID-0043 — Governed Publication Readiness Checklist (Scholar Council)
+
+## Problem
+Publishing “almost ready” content creates risk: missing attribution, unclear scope, unreviewed claims, and subtle bias.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must block publication if any gate fails
+- Must be auditable and repeatable
+- Must respect tradition scope and scholar constraints
+
+## Approach (Publish-Ready Checklist)
+Before publishing:
+1) **Scope declared**
+   - tradition scope + audience level clearly stated
+2) **Context card attached**
+   - matches standards; includes what-it-is/what-it-isn’t
+3) **No-paraphrase compliance**
+   - protected lines are verbatim
+4) **Scholar approvals recorded**
+   - scholar_signed_at present where required; blockers cleared
+5) **Bias/balance rubric checks**
+   - where comparative scope applies; avoid straw-manning
+6) **Editorial Approvals Lead gate**
+   - final approval recorded and versioned
+
+## Why it worked
+It standardizes “ready” and prevents accidental publication of unreviewed or contextless content.
+
+## Outcome
+- Lower risk
+- Higher trustworthiness
+- Cleaner audits and faster reviews
+
+## Where it landed
+Scholar-governed publishing readiness gate across projects

We’ve now covered the remaining big governance gap. Next is **Personal Finance Pod 5-pack** (budgeting, debt, savings automation, insurance review, tax/credit guardrails) unless you want something else next.
