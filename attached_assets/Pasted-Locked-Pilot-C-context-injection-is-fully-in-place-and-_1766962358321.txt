Locked — ✅ **Pilot C context injection is fully in place** (and still within your constraints: read-only, no schema changes, no auto-apply, no VSuiteHQ).

### Where we are now

**Phase 3A DoD is satisfied**:

* Connector fetch works
* Prompt augmentation is gated + safe
* Errors become `ERROR` blocks (no crashes)
* Feature flag `PILOTC_GG_CONTEXT_ENABLED` controls it

### What’s blocked (and why)

To generate the **Pilot C “real diffs” drop for GigsterGarage** (no placeholders), I need the **actual current code** of the affected files (the 7 target paths), because the fixes must be **line-accurate** to your app’s existing auth + query patterns.

Right now, I can’t see those files’ contents in this chat, so I won’t invent diffs.

### Fastest way to unblock (no new tooling)

Since your connector is working, use DreamTeamHub to fetch the 7 files and paste them here.

**Option A (recommended): one console fetch → paste JSON**
In the **DreamTeamHub** browser console:

```js
const paths = [
  "client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts",
  "client/src/lib/queryClient.ts",
  "client/src/components/timer-widget.tsx",
  "client/src/pages/productivity.tsx",
  "client/src/pages/mobile-time-tracking.tsx",
  "client/src/components/app-header.tsx",
  "client/src/components/QuickActionButton.tsx",
];

fetch("/api/connectors/gigsterGarage/files", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ paths }),
})
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(x => {
    console.log(x._meta || x.meta || x);
    // copy/paste x.files into chat
    window.__GG = x;
  });
```

Then paste `__GG.files` (or the whole JSON) here.

**Option B: paste the file contents directly**
Copy each file’s visible content from the connector UI and paste it.

---

## What I will ship immediately once you paste the file contents

**Repo:** `GigsterGarage` (manual apply)
A single, real patch drop that typically includes:

* **queryClient.ts**: `retry` function that returns `false` on 401/403, plus `refetchOnWindowFocus/refetchOnReconnect/refetchOnMount` tuned to avoid auth-spam loops
* **useAuth.ts**: ensure `authReady` + `isAuthed` are reliable and exported/consumed consistently
* **pages/components with polling**: guard intervals/effects so they don’t run unless `authReady && isAuthed`
* **global 401 handling** (if present): stop cascading retries, optional “silent” logout behavior, and prevent query invalidations from immediately refetching while unauthenticated

All with **file-aware changes only** (no placeholders).

Paste the fetched file payload and I’ll return the **GigsterGarage Pilot C drop** in the next message.
