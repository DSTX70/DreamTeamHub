+# EVID-0024 — Pilot Factory Operating System (Intake → SOW → KPIs → Evidence → Case Study)
+
+## Problem
+Pilots fail when they are treated like “ad hoc demos”: unclear scope, missing success metrics, weak evidence, and no path to a reusable case study.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be repeatable and light enough to run often
+- Must generate evidence, not vibes
+- Must produce output that can become a case study without rework
+- Must coordinate multiple pods without chaos
+
+## Approach (Pilot Factory OS)
+1) **Intake**
+   - Identify sponsor, problem statement, target users, constraints, timeline
+2) **SOW (simple)**
+   - Define deliverables, responsibilities, environments, data handling, and boundaries
+3) **KPIs**
+   - Define 3–7 KPIs that prove value (latency, cost, accuracy, time saved, risk reduced)
+4) **Execution cadence**
+   - Weekly pilot review (status, blockers, KPI deltas, evidence plan)
+5) **Evidence Pack**
+   - Capture before/after, logs, screenshots, and artifacts that substantiate claims
+6) **Case Study conversion**
+   - Convert evidence + narrative into an external-ready story (post-approval)
+
+## Why it worked
+It turned pilots into a production line: measurable outcomes, repeatable execution, and a built-in path to marketing/PR assets.
+
+## Outcome
+- Clear pilot success criteria
+- Faster iteration and stakeholder alignment
+- Evidence-backed case studies instead of memory-based claims
+
+## Where it landed
+Program Ops (Conductor-led) pilot execution governance

+# EVID-0025 — SOW + KPI Template Discipline (Decision-Grade Pilots)
+
+## Problem
+Pilot outcomes become unprovable when SOWs are vague and KPIs are undefined or subjective. This creates scope creep and weak results.
+
+## Constraints
+- SOW must be short and usable (not legal bloat)
+- KPIs must be measurable and tied to the problem statement
+- Must support evidence capture as part of the plan
+
+## Approach
+**SOW template fields**
+- Problem statement & target users
+- Deliverables (what will exist at the end)
+- Non-goals (explicit exclusions)
+- Timeline & milestones
+- Environments and access needs
+- Data/privacy constraints (if any)
+- Responsibilities (who does what)
+
+**KPI template fields**
+- KPI name + definition
+- Baseline (before)
+- Target (after)
+- Measurement method (how we prove it)
+- Evidence artifact(s) required
+
+## Why it worked
+It eliminated ambiguity, reduced scope creep, and made outcomes provable because KPIs were paired with evidence requirements upfront.
+
+## Outcome
+- Faster alignment with stakeholders
+- Stronger evidence posture
+- Cleaner “done” definition for pilots
+
+## Where it landed
+Program Ops Pilot Factory intake and planning

+# EVID-0026 — Evidence Pack → Case Study Pipeline (Truthful Narratives)
+
+## Problem
+Case studies fail when they are written from memory or marketing hype. Without evidence, claims are fragile and credibility suffers.
+
+## Constraints
+- Claims must be evidence-backed
+- Narrative must match what was actually proven
+- Must support internal and external versions (with redactions as needed)
+
+## Approach
+**Evidence Pack first**
+- Archivist/Conductor ensures the pilot has a complete evidence pack:
+  - baseline vs after metrics
+  - artifacts/screenshots/logs
+  - constraints + caveats
+
+**Case study conversion**
+- Convert evidence into a truthful narrative:
+  - Problem → Approach → Results → Proof → Lessons
+- Define which claims are public-safe and which remain internal
+- Apply privacy/security review before publishing externally (Sentinel/Praetor as needed)
+
+## Why it worked
+It kept storytelling honest and powerful: proof drives narrative, not the other way around.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher credibility with customers/partners
+- Faster analyst/PR readiness
+- Reusable proof assets for sales and marketing
+
+## Where it landed
+Pilot Factory → Analyst/PR pipeline (Conductor + Beacon)

+# EVID-0027 — Partnership ROI Rubric (Amani Lens) + Ecosystem Fit
+
+## Problem
+Partnership conversations drift into “sounds good” without clear economics or fit. This wastes time and can create bad deals.
+
+## Constraints
+- Must be SMB-realistic (operator lens)
+- Must clarify value exchange and costs
+- Must be actionable (next steps, not theory)
+
+## Approach
+**ROI rubric**
+- Value delivered (measurable outcomes)
+- Cost to deliver (build/support/sales time)
+- Distribution leverage (who brings audience?)
+- Retention/expansion potential
+- Risk profile (privacy/security/IP)
+- Operational burden (support, onboarding, integration)
+
+**Ecosystem fit**
+- Does it amplify existing brands or distract?
+- Does it integrate into i³ stack cleanly?
+- Can it generate evidence-grade wins?
+
+## Why it worked
+It replaces vague optimism with grounded economics and fit checks—enabling faster yes/no decisions.
+
+## Outcome
+- Better partner selection
+- Cleaner deal structures
+- Less wasted execution
+
+## Where it landed
+Program Ops + Partnerships governance (Amani)

+# EVID-0028 — Analyst Narrative Discipline (Beacon) + Evidence-Grade Messaging
+
+## Problem
+Analyst/PR narratives collapse if they overclaim or can’t be substantiated. Without discipline, messaging becomes inconsistent across releases.
+
+## Constraints
+- Claims must be backed by evidence packs
+- Narrative must be consistent with governance and safety constraints
+- Must be modular for different audiences (analyst vs customer vs internal)
+
+## Approach
+**Evidence-grade narrative**
+- Every marquee claim links to:
+  - KPI result
+  - proof artifact
+  - scope/caveats
+- Maintain a core narrative statement and supporting proof bullets
+
+**Packaging**
+- Analyst brief: what’s new, why it matters, proof, differentiation
+- PR summary: benefits, proof, safe framing
+- Internal memo: details + technical depth + risks
+
+## Why it worked
+It kept narratives credible and repeatable: proof drives claims, governance prevents overreach, and messaging stays aligned.
+
+## Outcome
+- Higher trust with analysts and partners
+- Fewer contradictions across releases
+- Faster briefing readiness
