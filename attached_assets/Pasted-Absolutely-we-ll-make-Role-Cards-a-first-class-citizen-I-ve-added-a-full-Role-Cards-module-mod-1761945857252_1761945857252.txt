Absolutely—we’ll make Role Cards a first-class citizen. I’ve added a full **Role Cards** module (models, API, seed data) to the starter so you can catalog every Dream Team persona with purpose, core functions, responsibilities, tone/voice, DoD, tags, links, and optional RACI entries.

# What’s included (Role Cards)

## New database tables

* `role_cards`

  * `handle` (e.g., Prism, Aegis), `title`, `pod`, `purpose`
  * `core_functions[]`, `responsibilities[]`
  * `tone_voice`, `definition_of_done[]`, `links[]`, `tags[]`, `updated_at`
* `role_raci`

  * `workstream`, `role_handle`, `r[]`, `a[]`, `c[]`, `i[]`

## New API routes

`/roles` (CRUD Role Cards) and `/roles/raci`:

* `POST /roles` – create a role card
* `GET /roles?pod=Marketing&handle=Prism` – list/filter role cards
* `GET /roles/{id}` – fetch one
* `PUT /roles/{id}` – update
* `DELETE /roles/{id}` – delete
* `POST /roles/raci` – create a RACI mapping
* `GET /roles/raci?workstream=OUAS%20Launch&role_handle=Prism` – list RACIs

These are wired into FastAPI and show up in `/docs`.

## Seeded role cards (edit/expand as you like)

Starter cards for: **OS**, **Aegis**, **Sentinel**, **Nova**, **Prism**, **Storybloom**, **Foundry**, **Ledger**, **Lume** — prefilled with purpose, core functions, responsibilities, tone/voice, and DoD checklists from your canon.

# How to run (updated)

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "from app.seed import seed; seed()"   # creates tables and seeds pods + role cards
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Open **`/docs`** to use the Role Cards and RACI endpoints.

(Optional frontend remains the same; you can add a “Roster” page later that hits `/roles` to render cards.)

# Quick test (copy/paste)

**List all role cards**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/roles
```

**Filter by pod**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/roles?pod=Marketing"
```

**Create a new role card**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/roles -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{
  "handle":"Echo",
  "title":"Social Media Lead",
  "pod":"Marketing",
  "purpose":"Plan, publish, and measure social content across channels.",
  "core_functions":["Calendar","Publishing","Community replies","Analytics"],
  "responsibilities":["Channel health","UTMs","Weekly snapshot"],
  "tone_voice":"Warm, witty, on-brand.",
  "definition_of_done":["Posts scheduled","Assets approved","KPI snapshot posted"],
  "tags":["social","content","analytics"]
}'
```

**Add a RACI entry**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/roles/raci -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{
  "workstream":"OUAS Launch",
  "role_handle":"Prism",
  "r":["Campaign brief v1","Budget sheet"],
  "a":["Channel mix","KPI targets"],
  "c":["Nova on creative","Ledger on budget"],
  "i":["Control Tower rollup"]
}'
```

**List RACIs for a workstream**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/roles/raci?workstream=OUAS%20Launch"
```

# Where the code lives (so you can tweak)

* **Models:** `backend/app/db/models.py` → `RoleCard`, `RoleRaci`
* **Router:** `backend/app/routers/roles.py`
* **Main registration:** `backend/app/main.py` (adds `app.include_router(roles.router, …)`)
* **Seed:** `backend/app/seed.py` (`seed_role_cards(db)` with starter personas)

---

# Suggested next steps

1. **Import all remaining personas** (Prism’s full team, Amani, Atlas, Coda, Archivist, Conductor, Pulse, Bridge, Verifier, Beacon, etc.) using `POST /roles`.
2. Add a **Roster UI** page:

   * Filter by Pod, search by handle.
   * Card layout with Purpose, Core Functions, DoD checklist.
   * “Add to RACI” button that posts to `/roles/raci`.
3. Link Role Cards into:

   * **Summon Composer** defaults (Phase 2).
   * **Audit Engine** ownership suggestions by Pod/handle.
   * **Brainstorm Studio** role chips (Pro/Adv/Neutral/Customer) mapped from tags.

Want me to auto-generate Role Cards for the rest of your Dream Team from our canon and drop them into a CSV you can bulk import—or wire a simple `/roles/import` endpoint next?
