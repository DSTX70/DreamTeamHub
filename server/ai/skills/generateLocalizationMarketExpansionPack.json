Pricing psychology: UK customers expect prices ending in .99, German customers prefer round numbers (€5.00 not €4.99). Canadian French vs France French: if targeting Quebec, use Canadian French translators. Dates and formats: EU uses DD/MM/YYYY, metric measurements. Shipping expectations: US customers expect fast shipping, EU customers are more patient but expect accurate delivery estimates. Payment methods: Beyond credit cards, support local favorites (iDEAL in Netherlands, Klarna in Germany/Sweden). Gift-giving occasions: Some markets have unique occasions (Boxing Day in UK/Canada, Jour de l'An in France).

Consider using UK fulfillment center if volume justifies (investigate Huboo or James and James). Phase 3 (Months 5-8): Launch in Australia - add AUD currency, international shipping rates, adjust delivery time expectations on site. Phase 4 (Months 9-12): Germany market entry - hire German translator for website, work with LGBTQ+ German community members to review card message appropriateness, set up EU VAT registration, possibly use EU fulfillment center. Translation process: Use professional translators with LGBTQ+ cultural competency, not machine translation. Have native speakers review and provide feedback. Test checkout flow in each language. Budget $5K-8K for German website translation. Prioritize high-traffic pages (homepage, product pages, checkout) over blog content initially.

Germany/France: Translation costs $5K-8K per language for core website. Professional LGBTQ+-competent translators charge €0.12-0.18 per word. Expect 10K-15K words for full e-commerce site. Legal/compliance: Budget $1K-3K per market for VAT registration, terms of service review, compliance consultation. International shipping: Negotiate rates with DHL, FedEx, or regional carriers. Expect 30-50% higher shipping costs than domestic US. Fulfillment centers: UK/EU fulfillment center setup $1K-2K plus per-order fees, but can reduce shipping costs and times significantly. Payment processing: International credit card processing fees typically 3.5-4% vs 2.9% for US. Add 1% for currency conversion. Marketing: Budget 2-3x higher customer acquisition cost in new markets initially while building brand awareness.
