These items are **locked** until the next quarterly review.

1) **Weekly Portfolio Review** (30–45 min) — Sage, Stratēga, Helm, Ledger.
2) **WIP Limits** as published in `40_Playbooks/wip_kanban_policy.md` (adjust quarterly).
3) **Promotion SLA** = 3 business days with auto-scheduling + OS escalation.
4) **APP CI Gates** — no manual bypass (Gate-1..4 must be green).
5) **Governance Metrics** — weekly roll-up every Monday posted to the Lab thread.
