# Purpose
This Heritage Pack preserves the **rich history** of Pods, Agents, successful patterns, and locked decisions created in ChatGPT so DreamTeamHub can retain the same operational strength without loss of nuance.

This is a **snapshot**, not a refactor.

# What This Pack Contains
1) Pods & Members (roles, responsibilities, DoD gates)
2) Agents (capabilities, boundaries, autonomy expectations)
3) Skills (depth definitions L0–L3, guardrails, patterns)
4) Locked Decisions (portable, durable decisions we keep carrying forward)
5) Evidence Packs (gold outputs with why they worked)

# Operating Rule
Agents do not "remember" history by default. DreamTeamHub must:
- Store canon + evidence
- Index it
- Assemble a Work Item–specific Context Pack per run

# Locked Decisions Carried Forward (Seed)
- /intent is the primary default entry point
- Pro toggle is global (header + sidebar)
- Ops remains in DTH, trimmed to orchestration ops only
- Commerce / retail routes are retired (legacy)
- Work Orders ≠ Work Items
  - Work Orders = templates / runbooks
  - Work Items = active work with Cast + Target Context
- Routing & Cast panel is first-class on Work Item Detail

# Definition of Done (Heritage Zero-Loss)
This migration is "zero-loss" only when:
- Pods/Agents in DreamTeamHub match the roster and responsibilities used successfully in ChatGPT
- Locked Decisions are persisted in a searchable log and referenced by Work Items
- At least 10 "gold outputs" are ingested as Evidence Packs with outcomes and rationale
- A Work Item Context Pack can retrieve the right heritage slices (pods/skills/decisions/evidence)
