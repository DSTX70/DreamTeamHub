# EVID-0012 — fabulousAF™ Brand Lock (Logo + Tagline Lockup)

## Problem
Signature brands lose recognition when logo styling and tagline presentation drift across merch, web, and campaign assets.

## Constraints
- Use the approved logo styling and tagline lockup only
- Do not invent new lockups, colors, or placements without approval
- Maintain consistent voice and punch

## Approach (Locked Elements)
- **Logo:** fabulousAF™ (fabulous lowercase, AF uppercase) with the approved color treatment
- **Tagline:** "I am. You are. We are." displayed on the approved red brushstroke background

**Usage governance**
- Treat the lockup as canonical across merchandise, web, and campaigns
- If a size/layout variant is required, it must be an approved derivative (not an invented redesign)

## Why it worked
The lockup is the identity. By freezing it, the brand stays instantly recognizable while everything else can evolve around it.

## Outcome
- Higher recall and consistency across touchpoints
- Less rework and fewer "almost right" versions

## Where it landed
fabulousAF™ brand identity system (logo + tagline lock)
