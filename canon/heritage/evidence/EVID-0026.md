# EVID-0026 — Evidence Pack → Case Study Pipeline (Truthful Narratives)

## Problem
Case studies fail when they are written from memory or marketing hype. Without evidence, claims are fragile and credibility suffers.

## Constraints
- Claims must be evidence-backed
- Narrative must match what was actually proven
- Must support internal and external versions (with redactions as needed)

## Approach
**Evidence Pack first**
- Archivist/Conductor ensures the pilot has a complete evidence pack:
  - baseline vs after metrics
  - artifacts/screenshots/logs
  - constraints + caveats

**Case study conversion**
- Convert evidence into a truthful narrative:
  - Problem → Approach → Results → Proof → Lessons
- Define which claims are public-safe and which remain internal
- Apply privacy/security review before publishing externally (Sentinel/Praetor as needed)

## Why it worked
It kept storytelling honest and powerful: proof drives narrative, not the other way around.

## Outcome
- Higher credibility with customers/partners
- Faster analyst/PR readiness
- Reusable proof assets for sales and marketing

## Where it landed
Pilot Factory → Analyst/PR pipeline (Conductor + Beacon)
