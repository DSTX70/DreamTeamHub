# EVID-0045 — Debt Strategy OS (Relief) — Inventory → Method → Timeline → Tradeoffs

## Problem
Debt payoff stalls when users don't have a clear inventory, payoff method, or timeline—and when tradeoffs aren't explicit.

## Constraints
- Educational only; no legal/collection negotiation authority
- Must be understandable and motivating
- Must remain compatible with maintaining minimums and essentials

## Approach (Debt OS)
1) **Inventory**
   - balances, APRs, minimums, due dates
2) **Choose method**
   - Snowball (momentum) vs Avalanche (interest efficiency)
3) **Timeline model**
   - payoff date estimates under different extra-payment levels
4) **Tradeoffs**
   - compare speed vs flexibility vs risk (emergency fund considerations)
5) **Execution plan**
   - auto-pay minimums + route extra payment to the target debt

## Why it worked
It turns vague anxiety into a concrete plan with options and clear tradeoffs.

## Outcome
- Clear payoff path and milestones
- Reduced missed payments via automation
- Faster debt reduction through focused extra payments
