# EVID-0052 — Tone/Voice Enforcement for Creative Deliverables (Sparkster + Storybloom)

## Problem
Copy and creative direction drift when tone/voice is treated as optional. "Almost right" voice produces brand inconsistency across products and channels.

## Constraints
- Must respect brand lock voice attributes per brand/collection
- Must avoid generic, default corporate tone
- Must keep claims verifiable and safe

## Approach
**Voice enforcement rules**
- Every public-facing deliverable must align to:
  - brand voice attributes
  - "do/don't" rules
  - canonical taglines/no-paraphrase items (where applicable)

**Roles**
- Sparkster: primary voice authority and tone gate
- Storybloom: narrative cohesion and PR framing (audience-fit)

**Execution discipline**
- Provide 2–3 options only when useful, always with rationale
- Prefer clarity over cleverness when stakes are high

## Why it worked
It prevents the "who wrote this?" effect. Voice stays consistent across time and across hands.

## Outcome
- Higher brand consistency and trust
- Better conversion and audience resonance
- Faster approvals because rules are explicit

## Where it landed
Creative & Design Pod copy governance across brands and launches
