# EVID-0001 — Standardized Work Item Context Banners + Clear Context

## Problem
Users arriving via "Next Actions" links were landing in filtered/partial views and could get stuck or confused about why pages were filtered.

## Constraints
- No schema changes
- Preserve existing pages (/ops/logs, /verification, /artifacts)
- Must work via URL query params reliably (refresh-safe)

## Approach
- Standardized query params: `workItemId`, `context`, `q`
- Added consistent banner: "Work item context detected"
- Included chips: WorkItemId + Context
- Included actions: Logs / Verification / Artifacts / Clear
- Added "Clear" that removes params (and clears prefilled filters on logs where applicable)

## Why it worked
It made state and causality explicit ("why am I seeing this?") and gave an immediate escape hatch ("Clear").

## Outcome
- Context followed users across pages
- Reduced navigation friction and re-filtering
- Clean HMR + no LSP errors confirmed

## Where it landed
DreamTeamHub UI: Ops Logs + Verification + Artifacts pages
