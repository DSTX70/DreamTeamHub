# EVID-0036 — Test Result Synthesis Pattern (Normal/Abnormal, Trends, What It Rules In/Out)

## Problem
Raw lab/imaging data is hard to interpret and easy to misread without a repeatable synthesis method.

## Constraints
- Educational only; not diagnosis/treatment
- Must avoid overclaiming causality
- Must include "what this does NOT show" (to reduce anxiety and confusion)

## Approach (Synthesis Pattern)
For each test set:
1) **What was tested** (panel/name + date)
2) **Key findings**
   - normal / borderline / abnormal (with reference range if available)
3) **Trend** (if repeated over time)
4) **Interpretation (educational)**
   - plausible implications
   - what it tends to rule out or make less likely
   - what it suggests could be discussed with a clinician
5) **Next questions**
   - "If X, ask about Y"
   - tests-to-consider (educational; clinician decides)
6) **Provenance**
   - link to source artifact + page/section if applicable

## Why it worked
It keeps analysis grounded and reduces misinterpretation by pairing findings with uncertainty, alternatives, and next-step questions.

## Outcome
- Clearer understanding of complex results
- Better appointment questions
- Reduced "chasing noise"

## Where it landed
Medical Pod evidence synthesis workflow (Avery-led) with specialist memo inputs
