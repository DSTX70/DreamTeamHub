# EVID-0060 — Strategy→Lock→Convert→Work Pipeline (Approval-First Execution)

## Problem
Brainstorming in chat is powerful but not durable: history, dissent, and refinement are hard to preserve and audit. Execution can also drift without a hard "lock" gate.

## Constraints
- Strategy must be first-class, persistent, and auditable in DTH
- No execution artifacts may be created without explicit lock
- Dustin Sparks remains sole approval authority
- Must preserve the full strategy context into the Work Item
- No schema changes required

## Approach
**Flow**
1) Create Strategy Session (NON-EXECUTING)
2) Iterate + refine → Save
3) Lock Direction (Status → LOCKED)
4) Convert to Work Item (enabled only when LOCKED)
5) Work page shows active execution (Work Items)

**Enforced gate**
- Convert to Work Item is disabled while Strategy status is OPEN
- Lock is required before conversion is allowed

**Conversion payload preserves provenance**
- title: derived from Strategy title (work item naming)
- owner: Strategy author
- inputs: full Strategy markdown body (entire thinking artifact)
- output/playbook fields: include provenance (strategySessionId, locked timestamp, repo hint) to preserve traceability

## Why it worked
It made "thinking" a durable artifact, and made approval enforceable (not implied). Execution becomes a controlled downstream step.

## Outcome
- Full end-to-end workflow operational:
  Intent → Strategy (debate) → Lock Direction → Convert to Work Item → Work (execute)
- Clear audit trail of what was approved and what was executed
- Reduced risk of premature drops or silent execution

## Where it landed
DreamTeamHub Strategy Sessions + Work Items conversion flow (UI + API)
