# EVID-0054 — IA Rules: Default First, Obvious Paths, No Hidden "Work"

## Problem
Users stall when information architecture mixes templates with execution, hides active work, or forces explanation.

## Constraints
- Default mode must feel complete and coherent
- Pro mode can add power without forking the product
- "Work" must mean active execution (Work Items), not templates

## Approach
**IA rules**
- Default landing: `/intent` for starting work
- Primary visibility: `/work` for active execution (Work Items)
- Templates live under a Templates section (Work Orders)
- Pro adds advanced routes but does not redefine meanings

## Why it worked
Users immediately understand what's happening: start work, view work, use templates—no decoding required.

## Outcome
- Less cognitive load
- Faster navigation
- Higher trust ("I can see what's being worked on")

## Where it landed
DreamTeamHub routing and nav conventions
