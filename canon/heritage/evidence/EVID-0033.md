# EVID-0033 — Compliance & Claims Guardrails (Kid-safe, No Unverifiable Claims)

## Problem
Brand trust is lost when marketing makes unverifiable claims, uses unsafe content patterns, or ignores kid-safe constraints where relevant.

## Constraints
- Claims must be substantiated or framed as opinion/aspiration
- Kid-safe compliance awareness where applicable (children's content/communities)
- Avoid platform policy violations and sensitive targeting misuse

## Approach
**Claims discipline**
- If it can't be proven, don't state it as fact
- Use evidence packs/metrics where available

**Kid-safe guardrails**
- Avoid collecting personal info from children
- Use appropriate language and imagery for child-focused audiences
- Keep community engagement safe and moderated

**Review gate**
- High-stakes posts/campaigns get an explicit review pass (LIAC/Sentinel as needed)

## Why it worked
It made growth sustainable: credibility stays intact and platform risk is reduced.

## Outcome
- Fewer retractions and corrections
- Lower risk of policy issues
- Stronger long-term trust

## Where it landed
Marketing & Social Pod governance with LIAC/Security escalation where needed
