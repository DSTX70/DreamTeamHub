# EVID-0059 — Templates Page UX Clarification (Default Calm, Pro Power)

## Problem
Users confused Work Orders (templates/runbooks) with active work, because the page visually resembled execution (runs/cost/stats) and used "work" language.

## Constraints
- No schema changes
- Keep Pro power available
- Default users must immediately understand the mental model without explanation

## Approach
**Default mode (calm templates library)**
- Intro card: "Work Orders are templates/runbooks. Active execution lives in Work Items."
- Prominent CTAs: "Go to Work" (/work) and "New Work" (/intent)
- Rename labels to template language:
  - "Create Template"
  - "Available Templates"
  - "Run Template"
- Per-row "Template" badge to reinforce meaning

**Pro/Advanced (additive)**
- Show/Hide Advanced toggle reveals:
  - caps, KPIs, playbook, and runs table
- Keeps power without confusing default users

## Why it worked
It separated "library" from "execution" visually and linguistically, while preserving advanced capabilities behind an explicit toggle.

## Outcome
- Default users no longer mistake templates for active work
- Pro users retain full visibility into template internals and run history
- Reduced workflow friction and onboarding confusion

## Where it landed
DreamTeamHub: `client/src/pages/work-orders.tsx` Templates UI
