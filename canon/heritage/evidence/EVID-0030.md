# EVID-0030 — Content Calendar System (Pillars + Formats + Cadence + Reuse)

## Problem
Teams burn out when content is created from scratch daily. Without pillars and reuse, consistency drops and quality degrades.

## Constraints
- Must be platform-native but reusable across channels
- Must scale across multiple brands/collections without voice drift
- Must be shippable (calendar you can actually follow)

## Approach
**Content pillars**
- 3–6 pillars that map to brand + offer (e.g., behind-the-scenes, product, story, proof, community)

**Format library**
- Reels/shorts, carousels, static, stories, lives, email snippets

**Cadence**
- Weekly schedule that is realistic

**Reuse rules**
- One "hero" piece → split into 3–7 derivatives
- Keep a backlog of evergreen posts

## Why it worked
It created sustainable consistency and lowered creative load while improving quality.

## Outcome
- Higher posting consistency
- Faster production cycles
- Better alignment with brand voice and offers

## Where it landed
Echo-owned content operations with Prism guidance on pillars and goals
