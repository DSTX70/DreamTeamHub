# EVID-0040 — Scholar Signed Gate (scholar_signed_at) + Editorial Approval Enforcement

## Problem
Even strong drafts are unsafe to publish if scholar review was skipped. Without a hard gate, "we meant to review" becomes "we forgot."

## Constraints
- Must be auditable and deterministic
- Must block publishing when required
- Must capture scope of approval (artifact + version)

## Approach
**Gate definition**
- Any governed religious/philosophical output is **Not Publish-Ready** until:
  - scholar review is completed, and
  - scholar_signed_at is recorded, and
  - no blockers remain

**Approval record includes**
- scholar seat(s) approving
- artifact/version reference
- signed_at timestamp
- notes (optional), blockers (must be empty for final sign-off)

**Editorial Approvals Lead responsibilities**
- verify scholar_signed_at exists
- confirm "no-paraphrase" compliance
- confirm context-card standards are met
- approve final publication state

## Why it worked
It replaces informal review with enforceable governance and preserves accountability.

## Outcome
- Fewer skipped reviews
- Stronger trust posture
- Clear audit trail for sensitive content

## Where it landed
Governed publishing gates for Scholar Council outputs
