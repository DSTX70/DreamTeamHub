# EVID-0048 — Tax + Credit Guardrails (Tally + Boost) — Education, Compliance, and Safety

## Problem
Tax and credit mistakes can create high-cost consequences. People need guardrails that prevent obvious errors and encourage compliant planning.

## Constraints
- Educational only; not a CPA/attorney
- Must avoid giving filing/legal instructions as a substitute for a professional
- Must keep recommendations safe, compliant, and conservative

## Approach (Guardrails)
**Tax (Tally)**
- Encourage recordkeeping and categorization discipline
- Flag "tests-to-consider" for tax planning conversations:
  - estimated payments, deductions, withholding adjustments (as applicable)
- Stress compliance posture and documentation

**Credit (Boost)**
- Utilization awareness and payment hygiene
- Dispute/cleanup steps framed at a high level (education)
- Avoid tactics that could be interpreted as fraud or evasion

**Safety language**
- "Verify with a licensed professional"
- "Do not rely on this as filing advice"

## Why it worked
It keeps users out of trouble: better hygiene, fewer avoidable penalties, and safer decision-making.

## Outcome
- More stable tax planning habits
- Improved credit hygiene and awareness
- Lower risk of harmful or non-compliant tactics
