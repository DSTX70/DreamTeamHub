# EVID-0017 — Cultural Nuance + Safety Review Pattern (Escalation Model)

## Problem
Some outputs require specialized nuance review (culture, religion, sensitive identity contexts). A single "general review" pass can miss context-specific harms.

## Constraints
- Must avoid overblocking routine work
- Must escalate only when needed
- Must produce clear sign-off ownership

## Approach
**Escalation model**
- LIAC is the default lens for inclusivity/accessibility.
- Escalate to specialist review when content includes:
  - culturally specific references that could be misused or misrepresented
  - religious/philosophical claims that require scholar governance
  - vulnerable audiences or high-stakes tone requirements

**How escalation works**
1) LIAC flags "Specialist Review Required"
2) Specialist reviews the flagged portions and returns:
   - approved edits + rationale
   - required disclaimers/constraints
3) LIAC issues final approval after specialist feedback is integrated

## Why it worked
It keeps the system fast for most work, while ensuring deep review exists for content that truly needs it.

## Outcome
- Better cultural accuracy and tone safety
- Clear sign-off responsibility
- Lower risk of sensitive missteps

## Where it landed
Dream Team Hub governance for nuanced publishing and brand safety
