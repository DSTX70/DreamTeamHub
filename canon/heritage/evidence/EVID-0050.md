# EVID-0050 — Template Governance (2-up, Square/Portrait/Landscape, Hero Crops) + "No Near-Match Templates"

## Problem
Templates multiply and drift: "almost the same" layouts cause inconsistency and confuse production, especially across collections (Fab Card Co lines, OUAS, etc.).

## Constraints
- Must use approved templates where locked
- Must not create "near match" templates without approval
- Must support multiple formats (square, 5x7 portrait, 7x5 landscape, web hero)

## Approach
**Template governance rules**
- Use canonical templates (e.g., official 2-up mockup templates) when provided
- If a new template is needed:
  - treat it as a controlled addition (versioned + change-logged)
  - document intended use + constraints
- Never fork templates silently

**Format discipline examples (from canon rules)**
- Remix Collection: square format direction (album-cover feel) and canonical 2-up layout
- Out Loud: rotate among square/portrait/landscape formats per rule
- Web hero: define exact dimensions and safe areas for headlines/CTA overlays

## Why it worked
It prevented template sprawl and guaranteed that production assets look cohesive across time.

## Outcome
- Cleaner brand consistency
- Faster design execution (less "which template?" debate)
- Fewer layout regressions

## Where it landed
Creative production governance across brand/collection pipelines
