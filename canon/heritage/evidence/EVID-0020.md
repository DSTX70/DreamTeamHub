# EVID-0020 — VSuiteHQ Ingest Integration (Receipts + Result Classification)

## Problem
Teams need proof that work outputs are stored and discoverable. Without ingest receipts, "it ran" doesn't equal "it's accessible."

## Constraints
- Must preserve outcome metadata (ok/failed, ids, storage type)
- Must support "drop" vs "recommendation" storage semantics
- Must not disrupt baseline execution paths

## Approach
**Ingest as a first-class optional step**
- Execution can run normally OR run with ingest enabled.
- When ingest is enabled, results are pushed to VSuiteHQ and return structured metadata such as:
  - ok: true/false
  - dropId
  - storedAs: "drop" | "recommendation"

**Receipt discipline**
- Store ingest status as a machine-readable receipt alongside other ship steps.
- UI surfaces results without requiring manual copying.

## Why it worked
It replaced "trust me" with receipts. Outputs became searchable, reusable, and attributable.

## Outcome
- Clear confirmation that results landed in VSuiteHQ
- Reduced manual copy/paste and lost work
- Better lifecycle tracking across Work Items and Drops

## Where it landed
DreamTeamHub execution → VSuiteHQ ingest pipeline
