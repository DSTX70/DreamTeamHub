# EVID-0009 — Brand Lock Governance System (No Unapproved Variants)

## Problem
Brand quality drifts when palettes/fonts/logos/voice "almost match" but aren't canonical. Over time, variants multiply, trust erodes, and teams waste cycles debating aesthetics instead of shipping.

## Constraints
- Must preserve exact brand decisions across many brands/lines
- Must be audit-friendly (what is "approved" is explicit)
- Must prevent silent drift ("close enough" variants)
- Must enable safe iteration (explicit change control, not ad hoc)

## Approach
**Brand Lock = Canon + Enforcement**
1) **Canonical Assets**
   - One official logo lockup per brand/line (plus explicitly allowed variants)
   - Locked color palette(s) (hex codes)
   - Locked typography system (fonts + roles)
   - Locked tone/voice attributes + "do/don't" copy rules
2) **Change Control**
   - Version + date stamped updates
   - Change log entries for any modifications
   - No retroactive edits without change log entry
3) **Enforcement Rules**
   - "No unapproved variants" is the default rule
   - If an asset/spec isn't in canon, it is treated as **not approved**
   - Outputs must reference canon (explicitly or implicitly through the locked system)
4) **Execution Discipline**
   - Exports include correct specs/sizes where defined
   - Templates are reused (avoid new "near matches")
   - If blocked (missing canonical asset), stop and list blockers (do not invent)

## Why it worked
It transformed "brand taste" into a deterministic system: fewer debates, higher consistency, faster shipping, and stronger trust in deliverables.

## Outcome
- Visual + voice consistency across brands and lines
- Lower drift and fewer "mystery variants"
- Faster production because rework is reduced
