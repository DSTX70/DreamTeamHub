# EVID-0055 — Default vs Pro Gating Convention (Global Toggle, Same Mental Model)

## Problem
"Pro" can create confusion if it changes meaning rather than adding capability.

## Constraints
- Pro toggle is global (header + sidebar)
- Default must remain usable without Pro
- Pro must never relabel core concepts

## Approach
**Gating convention**
- Default: core flows (Intent, Work, Templates)
- Pro: adds advanced views (ops orchestration, deeper logs, advanced filters)
- Pro features must be additive and non-destructive

## Why it worked
It protects comprehension: Pro is "more," not "different."

## Outcome
- Reduced user confusion
- Safer progressive disclosure of complex tools

## Where it landed
Navigation and feature gating conventions
