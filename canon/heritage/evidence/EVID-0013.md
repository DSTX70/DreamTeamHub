# EVID-0013 — The Fabulous Brand Company + FabulousGram Brand Governance (Channel Layer Without Drift)

## Problem
When a "delivery channel brand" (like a digital card/distribution layer) is layered over multiple collections/brands, it can accidentally override or dilute the underlying brand locks.

## Constraints
- Channel layer must not rewrite collection identity
- Voice/tone must remain consistent with the originating brand/collection
- No unapproved variants introduced through "templates" or "distribution formats"

## Approach
**House brand governance (TFBC)**
- Maintain portfolio-level governance rules (versioning, change logs, and locked playbooks where required)
- Preserve system updates with explicit version/date increments where mandated (no silent edits)

**FabulousGram as a channel layer**
- FabulousGram behaves as a **distribution wrapper**, not a rebrand:
  - It carries the originating line's palette/typography/voice
  - It may add metadata/format constraints, but does not alter identity
- Any "template" used for FabulousGram must be derived from canonical brand templates (no new near-matches)

## Why it worked
It kept the ecosystem cohesive: distribution increased reach without accidentally producing off-brand assets.

## Outcome
- Stronger cross-brand consistency
- Lower brand drift across digital channels
- Cleaner governance and auditability

## Where it landed
