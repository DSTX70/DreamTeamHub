# EVID-0022 — Deterministic Verification After Ship (Runtime Truth)

## Problem
Pipelines can report "pass" while the live URL hasn't actually changed. Without runtime verification, teams lose confidence in automation.

## Constraints
- Must verify against runtime (HTTP, endpoint match, artifact presence)
- Must produce machine-readable verify results
- Must surface verify outcomes clearly in the UI (human trust)

## Approach
**Post-ship verify step**
- Verification runs after ship and checks real runtime signals (e.g., HTTP match)
- Stores a structured result (ok/kind/matched/metadata)

**Work visibility**
- The raw verify JSON is preserved for audit
- A UI-level badge/banner summarizes the state for fast understanding

## Why it worked
It prevents "false confidence" by grounding success in runtime evidence.

## Outcome
- Higher trust in ship pipeline
- Faster detection of "ship succeeded but deploy didn't"
- Clearer debugging paths (verify result points to what failed)

## Where it landed
i³ shipping pipeline: post-ship deterministic verification + UI surfacing
