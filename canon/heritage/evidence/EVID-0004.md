# EVID-0004 — IP Pod Operating System (Aegis/Atlas/Archivist/Sentinel/Praetor/Coda)

## Problem
High-value IP work (patents/trademarks/privacy/OSS compliance) can degrade quickly without a consistent operating system: unclear handoffs, missing evidence, disclosure risk, and weak traceability from claims to implementation.

## Constraints
- Must be repeatable across brands/repos
- Must protect confidential strategy and sensitive disclosures
- Must produce filing-grade artifacts with clear deadlines and ownership
- Must remain "decision-grade" (auditable, evidence-backed, defensible)

## Approach (Operating System)
**Roles + responsibilities**
- **Aegis (IP & Patent Counsel):** claim framing, filing strategy, risk memos, docket + deadlines, final legal-quality gate
- **Atlas (Patentability/FTO):** landscape scans, comparator matrices, patentability/FTO opinions, IDS queue inputs
- **Archivist (Evidence Curator):** Claim↔Spec↔Figure↔Evidence matrix; Evidence Packs; provenance and traceability
- **Sentinel (Security Reviewer):** disclosure control, sensitive-system red flags, safe-publication gating
- **Praetor (Privacy Counsel):** DPIA/DPA guidance, lawful basis/retention guidance, privacy sections in specs
- **Coda (OSS/License Compliance):** SBOMs, license scans, third-party notices, CI compliance gates

**Workflow (repeatable cadence)**
1) Invention intake (scope + novelty claim + constraints)
2) Atlas search/landscape → candidate differentiation map
3) Aegis claim framing (broad core + dependent fallbacks)
4) Archivist builds traceability matrix + evidence checklist
5) Sentinel review for disclosure risk (what must not be revealed)
6) Praetor privacy posture + retention/lawful basis inputs (where relevant)
7) Coda OSS/license posture (SBOM/notices/gates) (where relevant)
8) Filing packet assembled + docketed deadlines + post-filing safe narrative plan

## Why it worked
It turned "smart people doing good work" into an **industrialized pipeline** with clear gates:
- legal quality (Aegis)
- novelty and risk clarity (Atlas)
- traceability and defensibility (Archivist)
- disclosure safety (Sentinel)
- compliance completeness (Praetor/Coda)

## Outcome
- Consistent, filing-grade outputs
- Lower risk of accidental disclosure
- Faster iteration because handoffs are explicit
- Higher confidence in defensibility due to evidence traceability

## Where it landed
