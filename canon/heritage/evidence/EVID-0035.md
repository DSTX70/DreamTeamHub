# EVID-0035 — Medical Record Ingestion Protocol (Zero-Loss History Carryover)

## Problem
History gets lost when "the system" relies on prior chat memory instead of a canonical repository of records and summaries.

## Constraints
- Must preserve original sources (lab PDFs, imaging reports, notes)
- Must support partial additions over time
- Must keep provenance: every summary points back to the source artifact

## Approach (Ingestion Protocol)
**Canonical storage layout**
- `/canon/heritage/medical/records/` holds source references and extracted text summaries
- `/canon/heritage/medical/timeline/` holds timeline entries
- `/canon/heritage/medical/briefs/` holds clinician-ready outputs

**Every ingested item must include**
- date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- type: lab | imaging | visit_note | symptom_log | medication_change | other
- summary (short)
- source pointer (file name, link, or "chat transcript reference")

**No-loss rule**
- Do not overwrite older summaries; append a new entry and link it.
- If a prior summary changes, create a new version and note why.

## Why it worked
It converts "chat history" into durable canon: searchable, versionable, and retrievable into future work without drift.

## Outcome
- Durable medical case history inside DreamTeamHub repo
- Better traceability for clinicians

## Where it landed
DreamTeamHub Medical Pod record-keeping + future Context Packs
