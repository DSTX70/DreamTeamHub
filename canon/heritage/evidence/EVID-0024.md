# EVID-0024 — Pilot Factory Operating System (Intake → SOW → KPIs → Evidence → Case Study)

## Problem
Pilots fail when they are treated like "ad hoc demos": unclear scope, missing success metrics, weak evidence, and no path to a reusable case study.

## Constraints
- Must be repeatable and light enough to run often
- Must generate evidence, not vibes
- Must produce output that can become a case study without rework
- Must coordinate multiple pods without chaos

## Approach (Pilot Factory OS)
1) **Intake**
   - Identify sponsor, problem statement, target users, constraints, timeline
2) **SOW (simple)**
   - Define deliverables, responsibilities, environments, data handling, and boundaries
3) **KPIs**
   - Define 3–7 KPIs that prove value (latency, cost, accuracy, time saved, risk reduced)
4) **Execution cadence**
   - Weekly pilot review (status, blockers, KPI deltas, evidence plan)
5) **Evidence Pack**
   - Capture before/after, logs, screenshots, and artifacts that substantiate claims
6) **Case Study conversion**
   - Convert evidence + narrative into an external-ready story (post-approval)

## Why it worked
It turned pilots into a production line: measurable outcomes, repeatable execution, and a built-in path to marketing/PR assets.

## Outcome
- Clear pilot success criteria
- Faster iteration and stakeholder alignment
- Evidence-backed case studies instead of memory-based claims

## Where it landed
Program Ops (Conductor-led) pilot execution governance
