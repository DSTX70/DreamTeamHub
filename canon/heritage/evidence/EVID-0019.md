# EVID-0019 — DriveSteward as the Shipping Artifact Spine (Intake + Publish-History)

## Problem
Shipping pipelines lose trust when artifacts are scattered, outcomes aren't traceable, and "what shipped?" can't be answered deterministically.

## Constraints
- Must be a single source of truth for artifacts and history
- Must be auditable (who/what/when/where)
- Must not allow risky execution paths through intake (governance)
- Must support "publish-history" queries for downstream systems

## Approach
DriveSteward functions as the artifact spine:
1) **Intake governance**
   - Intake paths are treated as storage/organization, not execution
   - "No execution from intake paths" is enforced via policy/CI guardrails (where applicable)
2) **Publish-history API**
   - Shipping actions record structured receipts (validate/apply/ship/verify)
   - History can be queried by projectKey/repoSlug/workItemId/dropId
3) **Artifact indexing**
   - Every ship produces a receipt and indexed artifacts (drops, manifests, verification)

## Why it worked
It made "shipping" evidence-grade: you can point to a receipt, find the exact artifact, and prove what happened without relying on memory.

## Outcome
- Higher confidence in the pipeline
- Faster debugging and rollback
- Clear lineage of changes and results

## Where it landed
i³ stack execution: DriveSteward intake + publish-history as a canonical record
