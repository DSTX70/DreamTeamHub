# EVID-0047 — Insurance & Risk Review (Shield) — Coverage Map → Gaps/Overlaps → Cost Control

## Problem
People either overpay for redundant coverage or remain exposed because they don't know what risks they actually have.

## Constraints
- Educational only; not a broker/agent
- Must stay practical and cost-aware
- Must identify both gaps and waste

## Approach (Insurance Review)
1) **Coverage map**
   - health, auto, home/renters, disability, life (as relevant)
2) **Risk inventory**
   - what outcomes would be financially catastrophic?
3) **Gap/overlap analysis**
   - missing coverages vs redundant coverages
4) **Cost control**
   - deductible strategy, bundling, shopping cadence, policy limits sanity check
5) **Action plan**
   - "keep / change / shop" list with priority order

## Why it worked
It creates clarity: protect what matters, avoid over-insuring what doesn't.

## Outcome
- Lower risk exposure
- Potential cost savings
- Better confidence in coverage decisions
