# EVID-0016 — Bias/Balance Rubric + "No-Paraphrase" List Discipline

## Problem
Even well-meaning content can encode bias (framing, assumptions, stereotypes). Without a rubric, review becomes subjective and inconsistent. Without a "no-paraphrase" list, sensitive canonical language can drift.

## Constraints
- Must be usable quickly (rubric, not essays)
- Must apply across brands and tones
- Must preserve canonical language where required

## Approach
**Bias/Balance rubric (fast checks)**
1) **Assumptions:** Does the content assume a default identity or experience?
2) **Representation:** Are groups depicted with agency and dignity?
3) **Stereotypes:** Any tropey shorthand, coded language, or caricature risk?
4) **Power framing:** Does it blame/shame or flatten lived experience?
5) **Accessibility:** Readability, clarity, and inclusive phrasing.
6) **Audience fit:** Tone matches brand without punching down.

**No-Paraphrase list**
- Maintain a list of "must not rewrite" canonical lines (e.g., approved taglines, legal/scholar-vetted phrasing, safety disclaimers).
- If a line is on the list:
  - it can be quoted as-is, or
  - replaced only via an approved change-control process.

## Why it worked
The rubric makes review repeatable and reduces drift. The no-paraphrase list protects high-stakes canonical language from accidental mutation.

## Outcome
- More consistent inclusivity outcomes
- Less subjective debate
- Stronger governance for canonical copy

## Where it landed
LIAC review process + governed publishing flows
