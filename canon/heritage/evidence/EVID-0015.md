# EVID-0015 — LIAC Approval Gates + Sign-off Capture Pattern

## Problem
Teams "intend" to do inclusivity review but it gets skipped under pressure. Without a formal gate, the system can't prove review happened.

## Constraints
- Must be auditable (who approved what and when)
- Must be simple (no bureaucracy explosion)
- Must clearly block publishing when required

## Approach
**Approval gate pattern**
- Any content flagged as **LIAC-required** cannot be marked "Publish-Ready" until sign-off is captured.

**Sign-off capture**
- Record:
  - reviewer identity (LIAC reviewer or council seat)
  - timestamp (signed_at)
  - scope of approval (what artifact/version)
  - notes (if any) and unresolved follow-ups (should be none for final sign-off)

**Blocking semantics**
- If LIAC issues a **Blocker**, the artifact remains "Not Publish-Ready" until the blocker is resolved and sign-off is reissued.

## Why it worked
It converted "review intent" into a **hard gate**. This protects the brand and creates durable governance.

## Outcome
- Fewer skipped reviews
- Clear accountability
- Easier audits and retrospectives

## Where it landed
