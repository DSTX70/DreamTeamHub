# EVID-0014 — LIAC Council Workflow + Activation Triggers

## Problem
Inclusion/accessibility/representation quality drifts when review is informal or optional. Teams miss harms, tone mismatches, or accessibility gaps—especially under speed.

## Constraints
- Must be lightweight enough to run frequently
- Must be explicit about when LIAC is required vs optional
- Must produce clear, actionable feedback (not vague "feels off" notes)
- Must preserve brand voice while preventing harm and drift

## Approach (LIAC Workflow)
**1) Trigger / Intake**
- LIAC is activated when content is:
  - public-facing and identity-adjacent, or
  - includes representation/identity cues, or
  - targets a broad or sensitive audience, or
  - becomes a reusable template/playbook, or
  - has any risk flags from team review

**2) Scope definition (fast)**
- Identify: audience, channel, intent, constraints, and "must not do" items.

**3) Review pass**
- Check for: stereotyping, exclusion, biased framing, accessibility gaps, tone drift, and "unintended implications."

**4) Output**
- Provide: specific edits, a short rationale, and severity tagging:
  - **Blocker** (must fix before publish)
  - **Recommended** (improves quality)
  - **Optional** (nice-to-have)

**5) Sign-off + logging**
- Approved outputs receive a recorded sign-off.
- Blocking items are tracked until cleared.

## Why it worked
It made inclusivity/accessibility a **repeatable gate** with predictable triggers and concrete outputs—without slowing every task.

## Outcome
- Fewer public-facing tone/representation missteps
- More consistent "voice with care"
- Faster revision cycles (feedback is specific)

## Where it landed
Dream Team Hub governance for inclusive publishing and brand-safe comms
