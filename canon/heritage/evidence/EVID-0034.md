# EVID-0034 — Medical Pod Operating System (Timeline → Evidence Map → Specialist Memos → Clinician Pack)

## Problem
Medical history becomes unusable when it's scattered across chats, PDFs, labs, and notes. Without a structured system, patterns are missed and clinician time is wasted.

## Constraints
- Educational support only (not diagnosis/treatment)
- Must preserve source fidelity (no "memory-only" summaries)
- Must be clinician-friendly (fast to review, structured)
- Must support ongoing updates without losing earlier context

## Approach (Operating System)
1) **Intake & source capture**
   - Labs, imaging, visit notes, symptom logs, medication changes, timelines
2) **Timeline**
   - Chronological event stream with dates + source pointers
3) **Evidence Map**
   - Key findings grouped by system (ANS, neuro, cardio, endocrine, sleep, etc.)
   - What supports vs what argues against hypotheses (educational framing)
4) **Specialist memos**
   - ANS hypothesis memo (Rowan) + tests-to-consider (educational)
   - Sleep hypothesis memo (Somnus) + screening pathway (educational)
   - Evidence synthesis summary (Avery)
5) **Clinician Pack**
   - 1-page executive brief
   - Questions list
   - Document checklist

## Why it worked
It makes a complex case reviewable: clinicians get chronology + signals + focused questions, and the system stays update-safe over time.

## Outcome
- Lower confusion, higher signal
- Faster appointment prep
- Reduced risk of losing key history across tools/threads

## Where it landed
Dream Team Hub Medical Pod governance + templates for durable record-keeping
