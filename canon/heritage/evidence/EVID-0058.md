# EVID-0058 — Context Surface Patterns (Chips, Banners, Clear) as a UX Standard

## Problem
Context is lost across pages without explicit UI affordances; users feel "stuck" in filtered states.

## Constraints
- Must be refresh-safe (URL-driven)
- Must explain why a page is filtered or scoped
- Must provide a one-click escape hatch (Clear)

## Approach
**Context surface standards**
- Chips for Target Context on list rows
- Consistent "work item context detected" banner on supporting pages
- Clear button removes context params and resets scoped state when appropriate

## Why it worked
It makes state visible and reversible.

## Outcome
- Less confusion
- Faster navigation
- Higher trust in workflow

## Where it landed
Work visibility surfaces (Work Tower + supporting pages)
