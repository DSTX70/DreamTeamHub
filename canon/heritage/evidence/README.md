# Evidence Packs (Gold Outputs)
Evidence Packs are "wins" we can reuse: patches, patterns, UX decisions, releases, or tactics that worked.

## Evidence Pack Template
Create a new file named `EVID-####.md` with:
- **Problem:** what we solved
- **Constraints:** scope/guardrails
- **Approach:** what we did
- **Why it worked:** the insight
- **Outcome:** measurable / verifiable result
- **Where it landed:** repo/path/page
- **Related Skills:** skillKeys
- **Related Decisions:** decision IDs
