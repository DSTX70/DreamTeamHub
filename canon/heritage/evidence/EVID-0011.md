# EVID-0011 — Fab Card Co Brand System Lock (Parent Brand + Collections + Format Rules)

## Problem
Multi-line greeting card brands drift when each collection invents its own look/voice, breaking the parent identity and creating inconsistent product quality.

## Constraints
- Parent brand identity must remain stable
- Each collection has a locked palette/typography/voice
- Collection identity must not be "blended" unless explicitly approved
- Format/template standards must be respected (avoid ad hoc layouts)

## Approach (Locked System)
**Parent Brand (Fab Card Co.)**
- Tagline: *Artfully Said. Beautifully Delivered.*
- Subline: *Because how you say it matters.*
- Voice: Bold, Inclusive, Witty, Emotional, Modern
- Enforce locked palettes/typography choices as defined in canon

**Approved Collections (locked)**
1) ColorCue (including the rule: always written as "ColorCue")
2) HeartScript
3) Midnight Express
4) The Remix Collection
5) Out Loud

**Collection governance**
- Each line uses its approved style board (palette + typography + mood)
- No "near match" fonts/colors
- Use the approved mockup/templates (including 2-up standards where specified)

**Format rules captured as canon**
- Remix Collection: square format direction and layout standards
- Midnight Express: upscale, tone-on-tone black with glitter/foil accents; holiday-focused direction
- Out Loud: approved logo lockup and format rotation mix as defined in canon

## Why it worked
It allowed creativity inside safe boundaries: each line feels distinct, but the whole brand remains coherent and premium.

## Outcome
- Consistent quality across collections
- Faster design decisions (rules are already chosen)
- Reduced brand confusion between lines

## Where it landed
Fab Card Co. brand bible + collection style boards + mockup/template standards
