# EVID-0010 — dreamshitter.com Brand Lock (Name Visibility + Character + Accent Colors)

## Problem
Satirical brands lose impact when the name is inconsistently applied, mascots drift off-model, and product/packaging visuals become incoherent across channels.

## Constraints
- The full brand name **dreamshitter.com** must remain visible as a brand anchor
- Mascot illustration must stay on-model (approved reference poses/palette)
- Accent colors must be used intentionally and sparingly
- No unapproved variants or "close enough" redraws

## Approach (Locked Rules)
1) **Name Visibility Rule**
   - The full brand name **dreamshitter.com** must be included across branding/product design/copy/packaging
   - Products must include the full brand name on at least one visible side/location when used
2) **Character Governance (Ronald a.k.a. Crumbles)**
   - Use approved palettes + official reference poses
   - Avoid unapproved facial styles and unapproved "flames" treatments
3) **Accent Colors**
   - Acid Yellow `#FFD437` and Gold Beige `#EEC95B` are approved accent colors
   - Use sparingly and with intent (not as dominant fills unless explicitly designed)
4) **Tone**
   - Satirical, sharp, comedic — but brand-consistent (avoid random edginess that breaks voice)

## Why it worked
The brand stays instantly recognizable (name + mascot), and humor scales across products without visual chaos.

## Outcome
- Higher brand recall (name + mascot consistency)
- Fewer off-model assets
- Cleaner product line coherence across merch and packaging

## Where it landed
