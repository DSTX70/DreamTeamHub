# EVID-0063 — Tenant & Billing Pod (Revenue Systems) (Security + Financial Boundary)

## Problem
Tenant isolation and billing are hard boundaries: mistakes can cause access leaks, incorrect charges, disputes, and security incidents. These concerns are specialized enough to require a dedicated pod.

## Constraints
- Approval-first execution (no silent billing changes)
- Staging-first verification before any production billing
- Webhook signature verification + idempotency required
- Audit logs for billing state transitions
- Privacy posture and retention considerations (as applicable)

## Pod Definition (Locked)
**Pod Key:** `tenant_billing_revenue_systems`  
**Purpose:** Own multi-tenant isolation, entitlements, and billing/subscription lifecycle safely (Stripe/webhooks/idempotency), with explicit approval and evidence-grade artifacts.

### Recommended Cast (Assigned)
- OS — orchestration + approval gates
- Forge — architecture and tenant data model
- LexiCode — implementation + patch drops
- Bridge — SDK/connector contracts (policy headers + audit)
- Verifier — QA (webhook/idempotency + regression gates)
- Pulse — perf/cost guardrails
- Sentinel — security boundary review
- Praetor — privacy posture/retention guidance (as needed)
- Aegis — governance/control points
- Archivist — evidence/traceability packs
- Ledger — pricing/unit economics sanity
- Navi — ops rollout sequencing (staging → prod discipline)

### Activation Rules
- Work includes: tenant, multi-tenant, entitlement, subscription, billing, Stripe, invoices, proration, trials, metering
- Any work touching payment flows or plan-based access gating

### Guardrails
- No production billing without explicit approval + staging verification
- Webhook signature verification required
- Idempotency required on billing mutations
- Audit logs required for billing state transitions
- No auto-apply by default

## Why it worked
It treats billing and tenancy as a boundary layer with gates, tests, and evidence — rather than "just another feature."

## Outcome
- Lower risk of financial/security incidents
- Clear ownership and review paths
- Higher confidence in revenue-system changes
