# EVID-0042 — Context-Card Standards + No-Paraphrase List Operations

## Problem
Sensitive phrases and canonical statements drift when paraphrased. Readers also misunderstand content when context (tradition, interpretation, scope) is missing.

## Constraints
- Must preserve protected canonical language exactly
- Must provide context so readers understand scope and interpretation boundaries
- Must be simple enough to attach consistently

## Approach
**No-paraphrase list**
- Maintain a list of protected phrases (approved taglines, scholar-vetted lines, safety disclaimers).
- Rules:
  - If it's on the list, it must be used verbatim (or replaced only via change control).
  - Writers may not "improve" protected lines.

**Context-card standards**
Each governed artifact includes a context card:
- tradition scope (single tradition vs comparative)
- source posture (scholar notes vs interpretation vs commentary)
- audience level (intro, intermediate, advanced)
- "what this is / what this isn't"
- required disclaimers (where applicable)

## Why it worked
It prevents accidental doctrinal drift and gives readers the interpretive frame needed to avoid misunderstandings.

## Outcome
- Higher consistency and safety
- Clearer reader expectations
- Reduced "tone drift" and semantic mutation over time

## Where it landed
Scholar-governed publishing standards and templates
