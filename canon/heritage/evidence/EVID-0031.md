# EVID-0031 — Influencer/Creator Workflow (Fit → Outreach → Brief → Tracking → Reuse)

## Problem
Influencer efforts fail when creators are chosen randomly, briefs are vague, and outcomes aren't tracked.

## Constraints
- Must protect brand voice and safety
- Must be measurable (not just "likes")
- Must be repeatable and scalable

## Approach
1) **Fit selection**
   - Audience match, tone match, content quality, platform relevance
2) **Outreach**
   - Personalized pitch + clear value exchange
3) **Brief**
   - Brand guardrails, key message, CTA, do/don't list, deadlines
4) **Tracking**
   - Links/codes, post URLs, deliverables, outcome metrics
5) **Reuse**
   - Convert creator content into owned assets (with permissions)

## Why it worked
It turned creators into a reliable channel rather than a gamble.

## Outcome
- Better creator fit and fewer off-brand posts
- Cleaner ROI measurement
- More reusable assets

## Where it landed
Marketing & Social Pod creator system (Echo + Prism)
