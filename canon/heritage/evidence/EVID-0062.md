# EVID-0062 — GigsterGarage Pilot Pod (Curated Cast + Approval-First Delivery)

## Problem
Pilots fail when execution lacks: clear ownership, safe rollout discipline, evidence traceability, and business/ops realism. "Fast shipping" without gates creates regressions and loss of trust.

## Constraints
- Approval-first execution (Dustin is sole approver)
- Non-executing outputs by default (paste-ready drops only)
- No schema changes unless explicitly approved
- Evidence-grade receipts and traceability
- Target isolation: GigsterGarage pilot repo

## Pod Definition (Locked)
**Pod Key:** `gigster_garage_pilot`  
**Purpose:** Run the DTH pipeline for GigsterGarage: Strategy → Lock → Work Item → Recommendation → Approval → Drop (manual apply), with QA/security/evidence gates and SMB viability checks.

### Recommended Cast (Assigned)
**Core delivery engine**
- OS — orchestration + gate enforcement
- Lume — UX clarity and workflow simplification
- Forge — architecture/backend correctness
- LexiCode — paste-ready patches + repo realism
- CodeBlock — modular/flag gating (adapter-first)
- Verifier — QA + CI gates + regression checks
- Pulse — perf guardrails (avoid regressions)
- Sentinel — security review and risk flags
- Aegis — governance/control points
- Archivist — evidence/traceability packs
- Conductor — pilot cadence + KPI framing
- Scout — research/validation support

**Business / SMB SMEs (required for viability)**
- Ledger — pricing/unit economics + billing implications + ROI sanity checks
- Navi — ops/process and rollout sequencing (how it runs in real life)
- Amani — SMB operator lens + partnerships/market-fit constraints
- ChieSan — experience/trust + customer-facing language nuance

### Activation Rules
- Repo hint includes `GigsterGarage`
- Target repo is `GigsterGarage`
- Any pilot patch cycle using approval-first execution pipeline

### Guardrails
- No auto-apply
- No VSuiteHQ push until explicitly enabled
- FILE/END_FILE discipline required for drops
- No schema changes unless explicitly approved
- Evidence packs required for "done"

## Why it worked
It keeps pilots fast but safe: the execution engine ships, the SMEs prevent non-viable choices, and governance/evidence preserves trust.

## Outcome
- Repeatable pilot delivery without silent execution
- Clear accountability per role
- Better "real world" viability (SMB + ops) before scaling

## Where it landed
DreamTeamHub cast presets + Heritage pod definition for GigsterGarage pilot workflows
