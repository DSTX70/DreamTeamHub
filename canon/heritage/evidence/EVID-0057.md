# EVID-0057 — "No Schema Changes Unless Approved" Operational Gate

## Problem
Schema churn creates cascading refactors and slows shipping. Many UX wins can be achieved without schema changes.

## Constraints
- Prefer additive UI changes and tolerant parsing
- Schema changes require explicit approval and rationale

## Approach
**Operational gate**
- Default assumption: no schema changes
- If blocked: list blockers and propose minimal schema change only if unavoidable
- UI should tolerate multiple backend shapes (normalizers)

## Why it worked
It preserves velocity and stability while still enabling UX progress.

## Outcome
- Fewer regressions
- Faster iteration
- Cleaner governance and review

## Where it landed
DreamTeamHub working rule and UI implementation style
