# EVID-0006 — Patch-Kit Strategy (Additive-only / Adapter-first / Feature-flag staged)

## Problem
Large refactors and "big bang" changes risk breakage, regressions, and loss of confidence—especially in multi-repo systems with interdependencies.

## Constraints
- Must preserve existing behavior by default
- Must allow staged rollout and rollback
- Must be paste-ready and low-risk for Replit workflows

## Approach
**Patch-Kit principles**
- **Additive only**: new modules, new routes, new flags—avoid ripping out existing behavior
- **Adapter-first**: build adapters around existing interfaces before replacing them
- **Feature-flag staged**: new behavior is gated, toggled on intentionally
- **Contract-first**: define the interface and expected outputs before wiring deeper

**Deliverable discipline**
- Provide paste-ready FILE blocks
- Include post-apply verification checklist
- Keep diffs minimal and reversible

## Why it worked
This strategy keeps shipping velocity high while protecting stability. Teams can test safely, compare old vs new, and tighten scope without breaking the baseline.

## Outcome
- Fewer regressions
- Faster iteration cycles
- Higher confidence in "ship" because changes are controlled and testable

## Where it landed
DreamTeamHub + i³ stack integration work patterns (patch drops, staged rollouts)
