# EVID-0028 — Analyst Narrative Discipline (Beacon) + Evidence-Grade Messaging

## Problem
Analyst/PR narratives collapse if they overclaim or can't be substantiated. Without discipline, messaging becomes inconsistent across releases.

## Constraints
- Claims must be backed by evidence packs
- Narrative must be consistent with governance and safety constraints
- Must be modular for different audiences (analyst vs customer vs internal)

## Approach
**Evidence-grade narrative**
- Every marquee claim links to:
  - KPI result
  - proof artifact
  - scope/caveats
- Maintain a core narrative statement and supporting proof bullets

**Packaging**
- Analyst brief: what's new, why it matters, proof, differentiation
- PR summary: benefits, proof, safe framing
- Internal memo: details + technical depth + risks

## Why it worked
It kept narratives credible and repeatable: proof drives claims, governance prevents overreach, and messaging stays aligned.

## Outcome
- Higher trust with analysts and partners
- Fewer contradictions across releases
- Faster briefing readiness

## Where it landed
Program Ops + Analyst Relations/PR (Beacon)
