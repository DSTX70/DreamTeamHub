# EVID-0037 — Specialist Memo Templates (ANS + Sleep) with Boundaries

## Problem
Specialist guidance becomes inconsistent without standard memo templates and boundary language. Medical content must be careful: educational, precise, and clinician-facing.

## Constraints
- Educational only; not diagnosis, treatment, prescriptions
- Must include boundary statement in each memo
- Must convert logs into structured hypotheses and tests-to-consider

## Approach
**ANS Memo (Rowan)**
- symptoms pattern summary (orthostatic intolerance, anhidrosis, etc.)
- hypotheses list (educational)
- tests-to-consider (educational)
- "questions to ask clinician"
- boundary statement

**Sleep Memo (Somnus)**
- sleep-wake pattern summary
- hypotheses list (educational)
- screening pathways
- clinician questions
- boundary statement

## Why it worked
It turns "medical chat" into something a clinician can actually use while keeping safety boundaries explicit.

## Outcome
- Better quality clinician conversations
- Less drift and less risky phrasing

## Where it landed
Medical Pod standard outputs for Rowan + Somnus
