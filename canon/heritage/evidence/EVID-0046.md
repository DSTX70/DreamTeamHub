# EVID-0046 — Savings Automation + Sinking Funds System (Nest) — Goals → Buckets → Auto-Transfers

## Problem
Savings goals fail when they rely on willpower instead of automation and bucketed intent (e.g., irregular expenses).

## Constraints
- Must work with irregular income as well as steady income
- Must be low-maintenance once set
- Must prevent "oops we forgot annual bills"

## Approach (Savings OS)
1) **Goal mapping**
   - emergency fund, taxes set-aside, travel, annual bills, replacements
2) **Sinking funds**
   - define a bucket per predictable irregular expense
3) **Automation**
   - scheduled transfers on payday (or weekly) into buckets
4) **Rules**
   - withdrawals are allowed only for the bucket's purpose
5) **Review**
   - quarterly recalibration (actual costs vs planned)

## Why it worked
It makes savings inevitable and prevents irregular expenses from becoming emergencies.

## Outcome
- More consistent savings progress
- Fewer surprise expenses
- Better stability during variable months

## Where it landed
Personal Finance Pod: Nest-owned savings automation and sinking fund discipline
