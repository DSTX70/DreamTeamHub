# EVID-0025 — SOW + KPI Template Discipline (Decision-Grade Pilots)

## Problem
Pilot outcomes become unprovable when SOWs are vague and KPIs are undefined or subjective. This creates scope creep and weak results.

## Constraints
- SOW must be short and usable (not legal bloat)
- KPIs must be measurable and tied to the problem statement
- Must support evidence capture as part of the plan

## Approach
**SOW template fields**
- Problem statement & target users
- Deliverables (what will exist at the end)
- Non-goals (explicit exclusions)
- Timeline & milestones
- Environments and access needs
- Data/privacy constraints (if any)
- Responsibilities (who does what)

**KPI template fields**
- KPI name + definition
- Baseline (before)
- Target (after)
- Measurement method (how we prove it)
- Evidence artifact(s) required

## Why it worked
It eliminated ambiguity, reduced scope creep, and made outcomes provable because KPIs were paired with evidence requirements upfront.

## Outcome
- Faster alignment with stakeholders
- Stronger evidence posture
- Cleaner "done" definition for pilots

## Where it landed
Program Ops Pilot Factory intake and planning
