# EVID-0056 — Page Layout Patterns (Tower → Detail → Deep Links)

## Problem
Users get lost when list pages, detail pages, and supporting pages don't share a consistent structure.

## Constraints
- Must prioritize at-a-glance visibility
- Must preserve "escape hatches" and next actions
- Must be consistent across surfaces

## Approach
**Pattern**
1) Tower page (list): at-a-glance status + context + cast
2) Detail page: full context + cast + outputs + next actions
3) Supporting pages: accept context via query params and provide quick jumps

## Why it worked
The user never hits a dead end: every page tells you where you are and what's next.

## Outcome
- Faster triage
- Less backtracking
- Better "state continuity" across navigation

## Where it landed
/work (tower), /work-items/:id (detail), /ops/logs /verification /artifacts (supporting)
