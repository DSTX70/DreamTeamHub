# EVID-0051 — Export Specs Discipline (Web + Social + Print/KDP) + Safe Area Guides

## Problem
Great designs fail in the real world when export specs are wrong: crops cut off text, print bleeds are incorrect, and sizes don't match platform requirements.

## Constraints
- Must export using exact specs, not approximations
- Must include safe-area guidance when needed (especially hero/social)
- Must preserve brand lock

## Approach
**Export spec discipline**
- Every asset ships with:
  - exact pixel dimensions and orientation
  - file format and naming
  - safe-area guidance (if overlay text may exist)

**Known canonical requirement examples**
- Book assets: 6" x 9" with bleed — 1875 x 2775 px @ 300 DPI (KDP spec)
- Web hero assets: exported to exact requested size with optional "headline space preserved" variant when needed
- Social variants: platform-friendly crops when required (e.g., 1080×1350, 1080×1920)

## Why it worked
It reduced avoidable rework and ensured assets look correct wherever they're used.

## Outcome
- Higher publishing success rate
- Fewer "please resize" loops
- More reliable templates and campaigns

## Where it landed
Creative export QA system (Nova-led) with spec-first delivery
