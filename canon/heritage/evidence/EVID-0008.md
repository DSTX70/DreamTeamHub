# EVID-0008 — Three-pass Translation Workflow (Izumi → ChieSan → Kaoru)

## Problem
JP↔EN translation for theatrical/culturally sensitive work fails when it is treated as "single-pass literal conversion." Nuance, register, honorifics, and dramaturgical intent require structured review.

## Constraints
- Must preserve meaning and cultural nuance
- Must achieve audience readability (not just accuracy)
- Must keep terminology consistent (glossary discipline)
- Must not publish without cultural review sign-off when required

## Approach
**Pass 1 — Izumi (Translator)**
- Produces publication-grade bilingual output
- Maintains glossary/terminology consistency
- Flags ambiguity with translator notes

**Pass 2 — ChieSan (Cultural & Aesthetic Guidance)**
- Reviews register/honorifics/idioms for cultural correctness
- Ensures localization choices land naturally
- Provides cultural sign-off notes

**Pass 3 — Kaoru (Dramaturg)**
- Polishes for stagecraft accuracy and audience readability
- Tunes rhythm/intent for performance context
- Produces final dramaturg-approved script output and adaptation notes

## Why it worked
It formalized the difference between "correct" and "ready." The pipeline ensures accuracy, cultural resonance, and stage readability—each validated by the right expert.

## Outcome
- Higher quality and consistency across drafts
- Reduced rework caused by late-discovered nuance issues
- Clear sign-off governance for publish readiness

## Where it landed
Parallax Translate / dramaturgy + cultural nuance workflow governance
