# EVID-0049 — Visual Asset Pipeline OS (Brief → Build → QA → Export → Manifest)

## Problem
Visual output quality drifts when assets are produced ad hoc: wrong sizes, inconsistent brand usage, missing source references, and unclear "final" states.

## Constraints
- Must enforce brand locks and canonical assets
- Must produce spec-compliant exports (web, social, print/KDP, merch)
- Must be audit-friendly and repeatable
- Must not invent missing assets; blockers must be listed

## Approach (Pipeline)
1) **Brief**
   - target brand/collection, purpose (hero/mockup/cover), required specs, usage context
2) **Build**
   - Nova/Walt produces on-model, brand-locked design
3) **QA**
   - check brand lock (palette/fonts/logo), layout rules, readability, safe areas
4) **Export**
   - export exact sizes/formats per spec (no guesswork)
5) **Manifest**
   - produce canonical filenames + mini manifest for batches

## Why it worked
It turns "design" into a predictable production system: fewer mistakes, fewer revisions, consistent brand execution.

## Outcome
- Higher asset consistency and quality
- Faster production cycles
- Reduced rework due to spec errors

## Where it landed
Creative & Design Pod operational delivery discipline (Nova-led execution)
