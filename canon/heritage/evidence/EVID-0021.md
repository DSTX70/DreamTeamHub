# EVID-0021 — Broadcast Release Events (Ecosystem Signal Without Manual Comms)

## Problem
Shipping changes across an ecosystem needs coordinated visibility. Without a broadcast event, teams learn about changes late, or not at all.

## Constraints
- Must be optional and non-blocking
- Must emit a consistent event payload (projectKey/repoSlug/version/notes)
- Must not require manual announcement steps to be effective

## Approach
**Broadcast release event on ship (optional)**
- When enabled, ship triggers a release event to Broadcast Hub
- Event includes identifiers and a summary suitable for dashboards/feeds
- Secrets/env are handled as configuration, not hardcoded behavior

## Why it worked
It "closes the loop" between shipping and awareness—making the ecosystem feel coordinated rather than fragmented.

## Outcome
- Faster awareness across teams
- Reduced "what changed?" confusion
- Cleaner release narratives tied to actual shipments

## Where it landed
i³ ship pipeline → Broadcast Hub release events
