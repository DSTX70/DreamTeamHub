# EVID-0039 — Religious Scholar Council + Writer Pool Operating System (Governed Publishing)

## Problem
Religious/philosophical content can be high-impact and easy to misrepresent. Without a governed workflow, outputs can drift, reflect bias, or accidentally rewrite sensitive canonical language.

## Constraints
- Must not publish without scholar approval where required
- Must preserve nuance and avoid oversimplification
- Must keep an auditable trail (who approved what, when)
- Must maintain balance across traditions when the scope requires it

## Approach (Operating System)
**Roles**
- Religious Scholar Council (seats per tradition)
- Philosophical/Religious Writer Pool (2+)
- Advisory Council Liaison (coordination + NDAs + scheduling)
- Editorial Approvals Lead (gates publication on scholar_signed_at)
- Scholar Ops Coordinator (queue, SLAs, tracking)

**Workflow**
1) **Intake**
   - define audience, intent, tradition scope (single tradition vs comparative), and risk level
2) **Scholar input**
   - relevant scholar seat(s) provide notes, constraints, and "do not paraphrase" flags
3) **Writer draft**
   - writers produce warm modern renderings strictly within scholar constraints
4) **Scholar review**
   - scholars approve or return edits (explicitly noting blockers)
5) **Editorial gate**
   - Editorial Approvals Lead confirms scholar_signed_at and closes blockers
6) **Publish readiness**
   - context cards, citations/attribution, and "no-paraphrase" compliance verified

## Why it worked
It separates "writing skill" from "authority and nuance": writers craft accessible language, scholars ensure accuracy and balance, and publication is gated by recorded approval.

## Outcome
- Reduced misrepresentation risk
- Higher quality, more trustworthy outputs
- Auditable governance trail

## Where it landed
Governed publishing system for religious/philosophical content across the portfolio
