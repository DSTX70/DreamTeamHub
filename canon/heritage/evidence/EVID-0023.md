# EVID-0023 — Per-drop Status Badges (Validate / Apply / Ship / Verify) = Work Visibility

## Problem
Users can't tell what happened to a change without drilling into logs. "Work visibility" requires at-a-glance status across pipeline stages.

## Constraints
- Must persist status per drop (not only for selected item)
- Must keep raw JSON receipts while showing simple badges
- Must be consistent across UI surfaces (dropdown rows, detail pages)

## Approach
**Persist per-stage receipts**
- For each drop, store summaries for:
  - VALIDATED
  - APPLIED
  - SHIPPED
  - VERIFY
- Keep the full underlying JSON payload available for audit

**Render per-row badges**
- Show badges directly in drop lists (not only on a selected drop)
- "Next actions" deep-link to the right filtered views when failures occur

## Why it worked
It reduced cognitive load: users can see pipeline state instantly and jump to the right next step without hunting.

## Outcome
- Faster triage and recovery
- Less confusion about "did it actually ship?"
- Higher trust and adoption of the workflow

## Where it landed
DreamTeamHub work visibility patterns (drop lists + receipts + next actions)
