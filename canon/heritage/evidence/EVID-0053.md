# EVID-0053 — Creative Review Gates (Brand Lock + LIAC + Safety Escalation)

## Problem
Creative mistakes become public mistakes when review gates are unclear: off-brand variants, accidental harm, or unsafe framing slips through.

## Constraints
- Must keep review lightweight but real
- Must clearly define when LIAC or Security escalation is required
- Must capture approvals for high-stakes outputs

## Approach (Review Gates)
**Gate 1 — Brand Lock QA (always for public-facing)**
- Verify palette/fonts/logos/templates match canon
- Block "near match" variants

**Gate 2 — Tone/Voice QA (public-facing copy)**
- Sparkster voice gate (and Storybloom for narrative context)

**Gate 3 — LIAC review (triggered)**
- Activate when representation, identity, accessibility, or sensitive audiences are in play
- Use blocker/recommended/optional outputs and sign-off rules

**Gate 4 — Security/Privacy escalation (as needed)**
- When claims touch security/compliance or sensitive system behavior

## Why it worked
It prevented high-cost public errors while keeping the creative engine fast and consistent.

## Outcome
- Less rework after publishing
- Higher trust in "ready"
- Safer, more inclusive creative outputs

## Where it landed
Portfolio creative QA and publishing readiness discipline
