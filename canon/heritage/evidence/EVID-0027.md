# EVID-0027 — Partnership ROI Rubric (Amani Lens) + Ecosystem Fit

## Problem
Partnership conversations drift into "sounds good" without clear economics or fit. This wastes time and can create bad deals.

## Constraints
- Must be SMB-realistic (operator lens)
- Must clarify value exchange and costs
- Must be actionable (next steps, not theory)

## Approach
**ROI rubric**
- Value delivered (measurable outcomes)
- Cost to deliver (build/support/sales time)
- Distribution leverage (who brings audience?)
- Retention/expansion potential
- Risk profile (privacy/security/IP)
- Operational burden (support, onboarding, integration)

**Ecosystem fit**
- Does it amplify existing brands or distract?
- Does it integrate into i³ stack cleanly?
- Can it generate evidence-grade wins?

## Why it worked
It replaces vague optimism with grounded economics and fit checks—enabling faster yes/no decisions.

## Outcome
- Better partner selection
- Cleaner deal structures
- Less wasted execution

## Where it landed
Program Ops + Partnerships governance (Amani)
