# EVID-0044 — Budgeting & Cash Flow OS (Harbor) — Plan → Cadence → Variance Review

## Problem
Money stress persists when budgeting is treated as a one-time spreadsheet instead of an operating system with cadence and variance learning.

## Constraints
- Educational only; no individualized financial advice relationship
- Must be simple enough to maintain monthly
- Must align with real spending patterns (not "perfect behavior" fantasies)

## Approach (Cash Flow OS)
1) **Baseline**
   - income streams, fixed costs, variable categories, debt minimums
2) **Budget plan**
   - realistic category targets + planned transfers (savings/debt)
3) **Cadence**
   - weekly quick check (spend drift)
   - monthly close (actuals vs plan)
4) **Variance review**
   - identify leaks, one-offs, trend changes
   - adjust plan (not guilt)
5) **Automation**
   - pay yourself first via scheduled transfers where possible

## Why it worked
It converts budgeting into a feedback loop: reality informs the plan, and the plan becomes easier to follow.

## Outcome
- Better control of monthly cash flow
- Reduced "mystery spending"
- Faster progress on goals through automation

## Where it landed
Personal Finance Pod: Harbor-owned budgeting and monthly health checks
