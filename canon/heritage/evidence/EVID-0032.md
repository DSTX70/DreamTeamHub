# EVID-0032 — Paid Prospecting Discipline (Budget Caps + Targets + Creative Testing)

## Problem
Paid ads waste money when budgets are unrealistic, targeting is unclear, and creative isn't tested systematically.

## Constraints
- Must fit startup budgets and scale safely
- Must define daily/monthly caps by channel
- Must define measurement and iteration cadence

## Approach
**Budget discipline**
- Define monthly cap → allocate by channel → enforce daily caps

**Targeting discipline**
- Clear audiences, exclusions, and hypothesis per campaign

**Creative testing**
- Test hooks and creatives in controlled batches
- Promote winners; pause losers

**Measurement**
- CPA/CAC, CTR, conversion rate, ROAS (as applicable), with weekly decisions

## Why it worked
It prevented "set and forget" spend and forced learning and iteration under clear constraints.

## Outcome
- More efficient spend
- Faster learning cycles
- Clear decisions on what to scale

## Where it landed
Prism-led paid discipline within Marketing & Social Pod
