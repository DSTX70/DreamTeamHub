# EVID-0038 — Appointment Prep Pack (1-page Brief + Question List + Document Checklist)

## Problem
Appointments are short. Without a structured prep pack, key details get missed and clinicians can't triage effectively.

## Constraints
- Must be short (1-page brief)
- Must be evidence-backed (not vibes)
- Must include a prioritized question list

## Approach (Prep Pack)
1) **1-page Executive Brief**
   - top symptoms + onset timeline
   - major findings (labs/imaging)
   - what has been ruled out (where appropriate)
   - current meds/supplements
2) **Clinician Question List**
   - top 8–12 questions, ordered by impact
3) **Document Checklist**
   - what to bring / what to request (educational)

## Why it worked
It improves signal-to-noise and ensures the clinician sees the whole case quickly.

## Outcome
- Better use of appointment time
- Reduced rework and repeated testing

## Where it landed
Medical Pod clinician-facing deliverable system
