# EVID-0029 — GTM System (Positioning → Channels → Offer → Measurement Loop)

## Problem
Marketing execution fails when "posting" and "ads" happen without positioning clarity, offer discipline, or a measurement loop.

## Constraints
- Must be usable for both early-stage brands and multi-line portfolios
- Must keep claims verifiable (no hype without proof)
- Must map channels to explicit targets and outcomes

## Approach (GTM System)
1) **Positioning**
   - Who it's for, what problem it solves, why it's different
2) **Offer**
   - The CTA and conversion event (what action matters)
3) **Channel plan**
   - Select primary channels (1–3) with audience rationale
4) **Creative system**
   - Repeatable content pillars + hooks; not one-off posts
5) **Measurement loop**
   - Define KPIs + cadence (weekly review) + next experiment

## Why it worked
It made marketing a system, not a vibe—every action ties to a target and a measurable outcome.

## Outcome
- Clearer execution priorities
- Faster iteration and learning
- Less wasted spend/content

## Where it landed
Marketing & Social Pod operating model (Prism-led strategy + Echo-led execution)
