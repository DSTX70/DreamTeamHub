# EVID-0005 — Claim↔Spec↔Figure↔Evidence Matrix Discipline

## Problem
Strong claims fail if the supporting spec/figures/evidence aren't mapped cleanly. Without a traceability system, gaps appear late (or during prosecution), and confidence drops.

## Constraints
- Must be usable by both legal and engineering teams
- Must scale across multiple filings and continuations
- Must remain auditable and easy to update as product evolves

## Approach
Archivist maintains a living matrix that maps:
- **Claim element** → **Spec section(s)** → **Figure(s)** → **Evidence artifact(s)**

**Evidence artifacts include:**
- logs, manifests, deterministic replay traces (where applicable)
- screenshots/UX states, API contracts, policy headers
- benchmark results / latency improvements
- design docs and implementation notes tied to repo + path

**Operating rules**
- No claim element is "green" unless it has at least one Spec anchor + one Evidence anchor.
- Figures are drafted to *teach the examiner* (system flows, method steps, UI states).
- Every update to claims triggers a matrix update (and vice versa).

## Why it worked
It converts "we think we support this" into "we can prove we support this," and it makes missing coverage obvious early.

## Outcome
- Fewer late-stage rewrites
- Stronger defensibility posture
- Cleaner collaboration across legal/engineering/security/compliance

## Where it landed
IP Pod program discipline (Archivist-led) used for filing packets and continuation planning
