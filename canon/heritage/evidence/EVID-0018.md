# EVID-0018 — Publication Readiness Checklist + DoD Gate (LIAC)

## Problem
Teams ship content that is "done" in intent but not in quality: unclear CTAs, accessibility gaps, tone drift, missing constraints, or unresolved review items.

## Constraints
- Must be easy to apply across brands
- Must prevent shipping with open blockers
- Must preserve brand voice while meeting inclusivity/accessibility needs

## Approach (DoD Gate)
Before an artifact can be marked Publish-Ready:
1) **No LIAC Blockers remain**
2) **Audience + channel are explicit**
3) **Tone is aligned to brand voice** (no generic drift)
4) **Accessibility checks** (readability, clarity, formatting)
5) **Canonical copy protected** (no-paraphrase items preserved)
6) **Sign-off captured when required**

## Why it worked
It standardizes "ready" across teams and prevents accidental shipping of half-reviewed work.

## Outcome
- Cleaner releases
- Lower rework after publish
- Stronger trust in "Publish-Ready" status

## Where it landed
Dream Team Hub publishing workflows and review gates
