# EVID-0043 — Governed Publication Readiness Checklist (Scholar Council)

## Problem
Publishing "almost ready" content creates risk: missing attribution, unclear scope, unreviewed claims, and subtle bias.

## Constraints
- Must block publication if any gate fails
- Must be auditable and repeatable
- Must respect tradition scope and scholar constraints

## Approach (Publish-Ready Checklist)
Before publishing:
1) **Scope declared**
   - tradition scope + audience level clearly stated
2) **Context card attached**
   - matches standards; includes what-it-is/what-it-isn't
3) **No-paraphrase compliance**
   - protected lines are verbatim
4) **Scholar approvals recorded**
   - scholar_signed_at present where required; blockers cleared
5) **Bias/balance rubric checks**
   - where comparative scope applies; avoid straw-manning
6) **Editorial Approvals Lead gate**
   - final approval recorded and versioned

## Why it worked
It standardizes "ready" and prevents accidental publication of unreviewed or contextless content.

## Outcome
- Lower risk
- Higher trustworthiness
- Cleaner audits and faster reviews

## Where it landed
Scholar-governed publishing readiness gate across projects
