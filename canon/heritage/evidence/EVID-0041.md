# EVID-0041 — Quarterly Audit Rubric + Change Log Discipline (Scholar Governance)

## Problem
Even good systems drift over time. Without audits and change logs, standards degrade, bias re-enters, and canonical constraints get lost.

## Constraints
- Must be lightweight but real (repeatable quarterly)
- Must track changes to rubrics, no-paraphrase lists, and standards
- Must include bias/balance checks

## Approach
**Quarterly audit**
- sample a set of published artifacts
- verify scholar_signed_at is present where required
- verify no-paraphrase compliance
- verify context cards exist and match standards
- verify balance/bias rubric adherence (where comparative scope applies)

**Change log discipline**
- Any update to the governance system:
  - increments version/date
  - logs what changed and why
  - references the approving scholar seat(s) (if applicable)

## Why it worked
It makes governance durable: standards remain stable, and updates are explicit and reviewable.

## Outcome
- Reduced long-term drift
- Higher confidence in published content quality
- Repeatable governance evolution

## Where it landed
Scholar governance maintenance and accountability
