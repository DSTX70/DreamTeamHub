# Decision: DTH-20251227-061 — Lock Tenant & Billing Pod (Revenue Systems)
**Date:** 2025-12-27  
**Status:** Locked  

## Decision
Establish `tenant_billing_revenue_systems` as the official pod for multi-tenant isolation, entitlements, and billing/subscription lifecycle work. This pod enforces staging-first verification, webhook signature verification, idempotency, audit logs, and approval-first governance.

## Rationale
Tenant + billing are security and financial boundaries; dedicated ownership and gates reduce risk and prevent costly incidents.
