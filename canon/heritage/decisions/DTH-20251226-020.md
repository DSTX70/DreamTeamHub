# Decision: DTH-20251226-020 — Deterministic Post-Ship Verification Is Required for Trust
**Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Status:** Locked  

## Decision
Post-ship verification must check runtime truth and store machine-readable verify results; UI must summarize outcomes clearly.

## Rationale
Prevents false confidence when "pass" doesn't match production reality.
