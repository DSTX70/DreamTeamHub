# Decision: DTH-20251226-058 — Strategy Must Be LOCKED Before Converting to Work Item
**Date:** 2025-12-26
**Status:** Locked

## Decision
Strategy Sessions are NON-EXECUTING. A Strategy must be explicitly **LOCKED** before it can be converted into a Work Item. Conversion must carry the full strategy artifact and provenance into the Work Item fields.

## Rationale
Enforces approval-first execution and preserves an auditable trail from thinking → approval → execution.
