# Decision: DTH-20251226-057 — Templates Page Must Be Calm by Default; Advanced Details Are Optional
**Date:** 2025-12-26
**Status:** Locked

## Decision
Work Orders are presented as Templates/runbooks with a calm default view; advanced details (caps/KPIs/runs/debug) are hidden unless explicitly expanded (or Pro).

## Rationale
Prevents templates being mistaken for active work while preserving power.
