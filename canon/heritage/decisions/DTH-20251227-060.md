# Decision: DTH-20251227-060 — Lock GigsterGarage Pilot Pod (Curated Cast)
**Date:** 2025-12-27  
**Status:** Locked  

## Decision
Establish `gigster_garage_pilot` as the official GigsterGarage pilot pod and curated cast. This pod is responsible for approval-first delivery using the DTH pipeline and includes business/SMB SMEs (Ledger, Navi, Amani, ChieSan) as required participants for viability.

## Rationale
Ensures pilots ship safely and credibly with gates, evidence, and real-world business/ops constraints.
