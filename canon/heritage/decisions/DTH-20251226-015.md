# Decision: DTH-20251226-015 — Cultural Nuance + Safety Escalation Model
**Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Status:** Locked  

## Decision
LIAC is the default inclusivity lens; escalate to specialist review for culture/religion/high-sensitivity contexts, with LIAC issuing final approval after integration.

## Rationale
Keeps routine work fast while ensuring deep review exists when needed.

## Scope
Outputs with cultural/religious/sensitive-audience nuance requirements.
