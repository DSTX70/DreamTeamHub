# Decision: DTH-20251226-018 — VSuiteHQ Ingest Requires Receipts
**Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Status:** Locked  

## Decision
When ingest is enabled, execution must emit a structured receipt (dropId + storedAs + ok) to prove the result is accessible and stored.

## Rationale
Eliminates "it ran but where is it?" ambiguity.
