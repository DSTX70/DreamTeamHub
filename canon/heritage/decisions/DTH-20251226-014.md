# Decision: DTH-20251226-014 — Bias/Balance Rubric + No-Paraphrase List
**Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Status:** Locked  

## Decision
Use a fast bias/balance rubric for LIAC review and maintain a no-paraphrase list for protected canonical language.

## Rationale
Makes review consistent and prevents accidental drift of high-stakes canonical copy.

## Scope
All LIAC-reviewed content; especially canonical taglines, safety text, and governed language.
