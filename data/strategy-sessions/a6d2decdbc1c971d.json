  "bodyMd": "# Pilot G — Draft Intent + Strategy\n> Repo: GigsterGarage\n> Meta:\n> - confidence: 0.7\n> - assumptions: Assuming the error occurs on save action\n---\n# Intent\n\n## Repro Steps\n1. Navigate to the Agency Hub.\n2. Perform a save action.\n3. Observe the error toast message despite a successful POST request.\n\n## Expected vs Actual\n**Expected:** After a successful save action (POST /api/agency/create returns 200), a success message should display, and the list should update with the new item.\n**Actual:** An error toast displays saying “Error — An error occurred”, even though the POST request is successful.\n\n## Evidence Needed\nCapture the network response from saved-items?type=marketing and any console error stack trace immediately after performing the save action.\n---\n# Strategy\n\n## Scope Lock\nInvestigate the client-side code responsible for handling the response of the POST /api/agency/create endpoint to ensure it processes a successful response correctly and updates the UI without showing an error toast.\n\n## Files to Fetch\nFetch the components or pages involved in the save action and response handling, especially focusing on those dealing with the POST /api/agency/create and saved-items responses.\n\n## Success Criteria\nThe error toast should not appear if the POST request is successful. Instead, a success message should be shown, and the saved items list should update correctly.\n---\n## Evidence Request (paste into Intent Evidence Needed)\nWhat is the exact error message or network response when the saved-items?type=marketing endpoint is called after the save action?\n## Suggested Files to Fetch (via connector)\n- client/src/pages/example.tsx\n- server/routes/example.ts",
