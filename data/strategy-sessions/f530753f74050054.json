  "bodyMd": "# Pilot G — Draft Intent + Strategy\n> Repo: GigsterGarage\n> Meta:\n> - confidence: 0.7\n> - assumptions: Assuming the error occurs on save action\n---\n# Intent\n\n## Repro Steps\n1. Go to the Agency Hub page.\n2. Click on the Save button.\n3. Observe the error toast message.\n\n## Expected vs Actual\n- **Expected:** No error toast should be displayed after a successful save. The success message should appear and the list should be updated with the new entry.\n- **Actual:** An error toast saying “Error — An error occurred” is displayed even though the POST /api/agency/create returns a 200 status with JSON content.\n\n## Evidence Needed\nWe need to capture the response from saved-items?type=marketing and any console error stack trace that appears after the Save action.\n---\n# Strategy\n\n## Scope Lock\nFocus on debugging the client-side code that handles the response from the POST /api/agency/create and the subsequent refresh action to fetch saved items.\n\n## Files to Fetch\nExamine the client-side components and hooks involved in the save action and response handling.\n\n## Success Criteria\nNo error toast is displayed upon a successful save. The success message appears, and the saved items list updates correctly.\n---\n## Evidence Request (paste into Intent Evidence Needed)\nWhat is the exact error message or network response when the error toast is displayed after saving?\n## Suggested Files to Fetch (via connector)\n- client/src/pages/example.tsx\n- server/routes/example.ts",
