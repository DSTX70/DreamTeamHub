What *must* happen before any recommendation or drop is allowed?\n2. What is the minimum approval artifact that blocks execution?\n3. Which tasks require a Strategy Session vs fast-path execution?\n4. Where do Strategy Sessions end and Work Orders begin?\n5. What information must survive as a permanent artifact?\n\n---\n\n## EXIT CRITERIA\n\nThis session remains OPEN until:\n- A clear direction is agreed upon\n- Dustin Sparks issues a **Strategy Lock**\n\nOnly after a Strategy Lock may recommendations or execution artifacts be created.\n",
