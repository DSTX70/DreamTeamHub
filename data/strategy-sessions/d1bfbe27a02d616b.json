  "bodyMd": "# Pilot G — Draft Intent + Strategy\n> Repo: GigsterGarage\n> Meta:\n> - confidence: 0.7\n> - assumptions: Assuming the error occurs on save action\n---\n# Intent\n\n## Repro Steps\n1. Navigate to the Agency Hub page.\n2. Attempt to save a new agency using the provided form.\n3. Observe the error message “Error — An error occurred” after attempting to save.\n\n## Expected vs Actual\n**Expected:** After saving, a success message should be displayed and the list of saved items should update to include the newly created agency.\n**Actual:** An error toast appears stating “Error — An error occurred” despite the API returning a 200 status code.\n\n## Evidence Needed\nCapture the response from the `saved-items?type=marketing` request and any console error stack that appears after the Save action.\n---\n# Strategy\n\n## Scope Lock\nFocus on the client-side logic that handles the response from the `/api/agency/create` endpoint and the subsequent update of the saved items list. Investigate any potential JavaScript errors or misconfigurations in handling successful API responses.\n\n## Files to Fetch\n- Examine files related to the API interaction and saved items update, particularly those handling success and error states on the client side.\n\n## Success Criteria\nNo error toast should be displayed after saving, a success message should appear, and the list of saved items should update correctly to reflect the new agency.\n---\n## Evidence Request (paste into Intent Evidence Needed)\nWhat is the exact error message or network response when the `saved-items?type=marketing` endpoint is called after saving?\n## Suggested Files to Fetch (via connector)\n- client/src/pages/example.tsx\n- server/routes/example.ts",
