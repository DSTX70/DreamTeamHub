and compliance in red. The color system lets you process information 
faster - your brain recognizes colors before reading text.

Clicking any pod reveals complete details: the charter or mission 
statement, purpose, pillar assignment - that's whether this pod 
focuses on Imagination, Innovation, or Impact.

[Scroll within pod details]

deliverables, and milestones. Everything you need to understand this 
pod's role in your organization.

Dream Team Hub manages 58 fully-specified agents. Each card shows the 
agent's title, handle, and crucially - their pod assignment via that

Platform architects, Marketing strategists, Operations experts - a 
complete virtual organization.

handle, pod assignment...

[Scroll through profile]

communication preferences.

[Scroll to RACI section]

The RACI matrix defines exactly what this agent is Responsible for, 
Accountable for, who they Consult, and who they Inform. Crystal clear 
accountability.

[Scroll to agent specifications]

a living resume - always current, always accessible.
