### Generating a Pack

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Open a Work Item**
   - Navigate to your work item from Intake & Routing
   - Or search for it using `Cmd+K`

2. **Prepare Work Item Context**
   - Ensure the work item has a detailed description
   - The AI uses your work item's title, description, and notes for context
   - More detailed work items produce better pack outputs

3. **Select Pack Type**
   - Scroll to the **"AI Pack Actions"** section
   - Click on the pack type you want to generate
   - Example: "Generate Pricing & Monetization Pack"

4. **Generate**
   - Click the pack type button to initiate generation
   - Wait 10-30 seconds for AI generation
   - You'll see a loading indicator during generation
   - Success message appears when complete

5. **Review Results**
   - The pack appears in the **"Generated Packs"** section
   - Click to expand and review the content
   - Each pack contains structured data specific to that pack type

**Important**: Currently, pack generation uses your work item's existing description and notes. Future updates will include pack-specific input forms for more targeted context.

### Understanding Pack Versions

**Why Versions?**
Every time you regenerate a pack, Dream Team Hub creates a **new version** instead of overwriting the old one. This lets you:
- Compare different approaches
- Roll back to previous versions
- Track evolution of your strategy

**Version Numbers:**
- **v1**: First generation
- **v2**: First regeneration
- **v3**: Second regeneration
- And so on...

**Viewing Versions:**
- Each pack card shows its version number
- All versions are listed in chronological order
- Latest version appears at the top
- Previous versions remain accessible for reference

**Note**: UI enhancements for side-by-side version comparison are planned for future releases.

### Interpreting Pack Results

**What to Look For:**

1. **Summary Section**: Quick overview with key highlights
2. **Structured Data**: Tables, lists, and organized information
3. **Recommendations**: Action items and next steps
4. **Open Questions**: Items needing clarification or decisions

**Quality Indicators:**
- ✅ **Good Pack**: Detailed, specific, actionable content
- ⚠️ **Review Needed**: Generic content or placeholders
- ❌ **Error**: Validation failed (see Troubleshooting)

**What to Do Next:**
1. Review pack content for accuracy
2. Share with stakeholders for feedback
3. Export to DOCX for distribution
4. Regenerate if adjustments needed
5. Publish to Google Drive for team access

## Exporting & Publishing

### Exporting Packs to DOCX

**Why Export?**
- Share with external stakeholders
- Create offline documentation
- Archive for compliance/records

**How to Export:**

**Via API** (current method):
```
GET /api/work-items/{workItemId}/packs/{packType}/export?version={version}
```

**Example**:
```
GET /api/work-items/123/packs/pricing_monetization/export?version=2
```

**Note**: User-friendly export buttons in the UI are planned for a future release. For now, contact your ops admin to export specific pack versions, or use the API endpoint directly if you're comfortable with browser developer tools.

**Export File Structure:**
- Title page with work item details
- Table of contents (for complex packs)
- Formatted sections with tables and lists
- Footer with generation date and version

### Publishing to Google Drive

**Current Status**: Google Drive publishing is available via backend API but not yet accessible through UI buttons.

**How to Publish** (requires ops admin):
1. Contact your ops admin with:
   - Work item ID
   - Pack type
   - Version number to publish
2. Admin can publish using backend API endpoint
3. Published file appears in configured Drive folder

**Drive Organization:**
- Each pack type has its own folder (configured by ops)
- Files named: `{work-item-title}_{pack-type}_v{version}.docx`
- Publishing overwrites if same version already exists

**Future Enhancement**: Self-service "Publish to Drive" buttons are planned for a future release.

## Troubleshooting

### Pack Generation Fails

**Symptom**: Error message "Pack generation failed"

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Missing Required Fields**: Check that all required inputs are filled
2. **Invalid Input Format**: Ensure inputs match expected format (e.g., numbers for numeric fields)
3. **OpenAI Quota**: Rare, but AI service might be temporarily unavailable

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check all required fields are filled
2. Try with simplified inputs first
3. Wait 1-2 minutes and retry
4. Contact support if issue persists

### Pack Has Generic/Placeholder Content

**Symptom**: Pack generated but content is generic (e.g., "Strategy 1", "Strategy 2")

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Insufficient Context**: Not enough detail in input fields
2. **Vague Inputs**: Generic descriptions produce generic outputs

**Solutions:**
1. Regenerate with more specific inputs
2. Add concrete examples and details
3. Reference existing documents or strategies
4. Use bullet points for multiple aspects

### Can't Find Generated Pack

**Symptom**: Pack generation succeeded but can't see it

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page (`F5` or `Cmd+R`)
2. Check you're viewing the correct work item
3. Scroll to **"Generated Packs"** section (may be below other content)
4. Check if pack is collapsed - click to expand

### Export Download Fails

**Symptom**: Export button clicked but no download starts

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser popup blocker settings
2. Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. Check file system permissions
4. Verify pack actually exists (try viewing it first)
5. Contact support if issue persists

### Version Number Confusion

**Symptom**: Unexpected version numbers (e.g., v3 when you expected v2)

**Explanation:**
- Version numbers are per work item AND per pack type
- If you regenerated a pack on a different work item, that's a separate v1
- Old test generations from months ago may have created early versions

**Solution:**
- Focus on the latest version (highest number)
- Check created_at timestamp to see generation time
- Previous versions are safe to ignore unless you need to reference them

## FAQs

### General Questions

**Q: How long does pack generation take?**
A: Typically 10-30 seconds, depending on pack complexity and current AI service load.

**Q: Can I edit a generated pack?**
A: Not directly in the platform. Packs are stored as JSON data in the database. To edit:
1. Request export via ops admin (or use API endpoint)
2. Edit the exported DOCX in Microsoft Word or Google Docs
3. Alternatively, regenerate the pack with updated work item context for a new version

**Q: Are packs saved automatically?**
A: Yes! Every pack is saved to the database immediately upon successful generation.

**Q: Can I delete a pack version?**
A: Currently, no. This preserves complete version history. Contact ops admin if deletion is critical.

**Q: Do packs cost money to generate?**
A: Pack generation uses AI credits (OpenAI GPT-4). Your organization has a budget. Contact ops admin for budget details.

### Pack-Specific Questions

**Q: Which pack should I use for pricing strategy?**
A: Use **Pricing & Monetization Pack** for comprehensive pricing models, tiers, and revenue projections.

**Q: I need a product launch plan. Which pack?**
A: Use **Launch Plan Pack** for timeline, channels, assets, and KPIs.

**Q: How do I create partnership proposals?**
A: Use **GlobalCollabs Partnership Pack** for partnership frameworks, candidates, and deal structures.

**Q: I want to audit our website. Which pack?**
A: Use **Website Audit Pack** for page-by-page findings, checklist, and remediation roadmap.

**Q: Can I combine multiple packs for one work item?**
A: Yes! Generate as many pack types as needed for a single work item. Each is stored separately.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What AI model powers pack generation?**
A: OpenAI GPT-4, configured with specialized prompts for each pack type.

**Q: Are packs secure?**
A: Yes. All pack data is stored in encrypted database, accessible only to authenticated users with appropriate permissions.

**Q: Can I see pack generation history?**
A: Yes, via version numbers and timestamps. Each version shows when it was created.

**Q: What happens if AI generates incorrect information?**
A: Always review pack content critically. Regenerate with more specific inputs if needed. Packs are starting points, not final deliverables.
